callumdignan,9,9 March 2024,"If this dosen't get renewed for a season 2 myself and I imagine plenty of other people will riot. A majority of the stuff netflix puts out is mediocre at best and most of it you forget after watching because its just mush. Most of it feels like it's purely just to keep the content machine flowing. The gentlemen feels totally different and might actually be one of the greatest shows I've seen and it's only the first season.Top acting, top direction, top writing, top everything basically. Guy Ritchie is absolutely on form here. Had me right on the edge of my seat for a majority of the show trying to work out all the angles, agendas, schemes going on between the multiple calculated characters through out the show and on so many occasions I thought I had it worked out until a few moments later I'd be proven wrong again with another brilliantly executed twist.The gentlemen (2019) was already a fantastic film but what limited it was the time it had to tell its story however giving Guy Ritchie and his team a full 8 episodes to play with to fully pad out this story was very clearly an excellent choice and I truly hope this show takes off in a big way not only because it deserves it but because Netflix will hopefully realise what a treat this show is and give us more seasons.I could go on for ages about this show but I'd rather leave as much detail out of this review as possible because I went into this series essentially blind and I absolutely loved it however I imagine knowing more of the details before hand wouldn't have had the same impact so if you can, watch this before you learn any more about it, trust me.So in short, watch this show. As soon as possible. Its fantastic.",The best thing Netflix has produced in a very long time
Rob1331,9,7 March 2024,"The Gentleman is a spin off of the movie of the same name. The movie was great and had big stars involved in it like Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, Jeremy Strong among others so based off that star power alone I thought this wouldn't measure up. I was wrong. This was brilliant. I literally couldn't stop watching this and enjoyed every second of it. The story is about an aristocrat (Theo James) who inherits the family estate. He's unaware that that estate includes running one of the biggest drug empires in the country. That drug syndicate doesn't plan on going anywhere either. You can tell Guy Ritchie was heavily involved in this because it has his style all over it. If you like his films you'll like this series too.",Enjoyed Every Second
Supermanfan-13,9,8 March 2024,"As a big fan of Guy Ritchie and the movie that this was based off, The Gentleman, I've been looking forward to this since I first heard about it, especially when I heard Ritchie was also creating it and even directing episodes. Even though it's not quite as good as the movie it's still very good and absolutely worth your time to watch this. I enjoyed the style of this series. It makes you enjoy every character and actually care about what happens to them. Theo James was terrific as the lead and between his performance in this and The White Lotus last year I hope it leads to even bigger things for him. If you're looking for a new show that is just a fun watch then this is it. I really hope they do several seasons of this because I'm fully invested.",Excellent
Twi12,10,8 March 2024,"This is a reminder that TV can just freaking fun and not take itself so seriously! The Gentlemen S1 stands out as a pinnacle of escapism, blending sharp wit, a plot full of intrigue, and a charismatic ensemble cast into a cinematic experience that captivates and entertains from start to finish. Guy Ritchie's unique storytelling style of- by fast-paced dialogue, complex characters, and stylish direction-creates a world that, while grounded in the grit and machinations of the criminal underworld, feels almost fantastical in its execution. Watch the full season as it sets up for what can be an even better second season.","Brilliant, unique Spin-off"
Sarah423,9,10 March 2024,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, although I acknowledge that I easily cleared two hurdles that viewers with lower ratings might not:
I loved Guy Ritchie's style and didn't find it getting old on me;
I didn't know about any movie, so I'm seeing these as ""fresh"" takes from the start.Every character in this series was fun to get to know and to try to understand. What complexity. What eccentricity along with believable nuance.Every actor succeeded in pulling off finely crafted individuals that fit perfectly into the sometimes off-the-wall plot.They lure viewers in, which is a great reason to keep going.Another great reason, of course, is that plot.What a ride!","Stylized, Classic"
bbraddock-49896,9,7 March 2024,"If you like this sort of thing: wild, over the top and sometimes ruthless British blokes with a dark sense of humor, you'll probably watch in one binge sitting.For myself, I found a lot of new faces, so I didn't know what to expect. The leads are entertaining. Vinnie Jones is a nice addition, as a more laid back, but don't mess with me fellow.The old English estate setting is great to look at in itself.Once again, Guy Richie has no problem creating a rich environment, and dialog is cleaver and sharp.Grab a bottle of wine and enjoy the ride.Never going to top Lock, Stock, Etc or Snatch, but this is great fun.Highly recommended.",WITTY FUN
leftbanker-1,9,10 March 2024,"If that makes any sense. What I'm trying to say while pointing Aristotle's quote into a mirror, is that this is worth watching simply for all of the outstanding individual performances. There are many other reasons to tune in, but the acting clinic on parade here is a lot of fun.The Parts:#1 - The StoryOf course, this story began with the film but has only a very tangential relationship with that work. Every episode has a beginning, middle, and an end, as well as a cliffhanger or something else to propel viewers onward. As with his movies, some of the stories worked for me, others didn't. Some of the conflicts were just way too facile with their resolutions. Eddie was pushed into way too many predicaments as he tried to extract his family from the business, accepting too many dangerous assignments for reasons not adequately explained, not to me.#2 - The DialogueRitchie seems to have developed his own form of dialogue in which street toughs and lowlifes converse with a sort of modern day Shakespearean banter, well above the vernacular of the average dirtbag, whether in real life or in other movies. While Tarantino was propelled into stardom for the way in which some of his characters lapse into long soliloquys, whether on their own or in a group, Ritchie's creations throw around a lot of word-a-day calendar vocabulary in their speechifying. It comes off affected at times, but more often than not his dialogue is a lot of fun.#3 - The CharactersBringing fun-as-hell characters to life on the screen is definitely Ritchie's strong point, or one of them. Eddie, Susie, Jimmy, Bobby, and Geoff could all walk away from this and carry their own series. It helps to have such talented actors reading you lines, and it definitely is important for actors to have great material to spin into the roles they help to create.Compared to about 99% of what is out there in TV and movie land, this series was positively brilliant. Period.",The Sum of Its Parts is Greater than the Whole
DazzlaMF,9,7 March 2024,"Taking the same path of the movie, this Netflix series follows the adventures of former soldier and recently titled Eddie, who inherits the family estate, and unknowingly, a joint-venture weed empire with a London gang.And it's this entertaining clash of old-English aristocracy and contemporary London drug gang that makes this series entertaining. Eddies older brother, Freddie, who should have inherited, is errant if well meaning, provides some classic ineptitude for comedy value.And there's a good balance of romantic tension between Eddie and the daughter of the gang's boss to keep you guessing. The casting is good, production values high and storylines engaging.Witty, stylish and fun, it's a good addition to the Netflix lineup. Not too serious and gory, but with enough tension and characters to keep you entertained.",Quality entertainment in classic Guy Ritchie style
danielportman-58376,9,8 March 2024,"When I initially tuned in, I anticipated a B-grade, easy-watching spin-off from a beloved film. Little did I know that Guy Ritchie was involved. After the first episode, I realized what I'd signed up for and relished every moment of the journey.True to form, the series delivered a plethora of dynamic characters, accompanied by snappy, witty dialogue and intricately woven plot points. It epitomizes the quintessential Guy Ritchie style, offering an extended exploration of characters and storylines.In conclusion, if you have a penchant for gritty UK mobster shows, this one is tailor-made for you.

gekko_050,6,7 March 2024,"Sleek, cool, funny, and exactly what you'd expect from Guy Ritche when he's on form (his track record is 50/50) at first.After a couple of episodes it becomes more apparent that while there is an attempt at an overall story, it becomes a ramble with each episode bringing new characters with new problems that needs to be resolved, and it begins to lose its pace and cohesion which is a shame.The characters are good, the dialogue is good and it is well filmed, but the writing badly lets it down. The formula that works as a fun 90 minutes in a Guy Ritchie film repeated over 10 episodes wears very very thin unfortunately.It could have been so much better which is a shame.","Started well, then it rambles on to nowhere."
richiehart-37900,10,7 March 2024,"Well worth a watch - instant classic. Guy Ritchie making a series is just a wonderful thing. 8 pockets of brilliance, almost like 8 movies in one.Main characters absolutely knock it out of the park.. also you have to love the nods to various other shows and series throughout. A refreshing set of new faces as well.I also really enjoyed the fact the locations used were NOT ones that were obvious / well known. None of the old tired locations like Dyrham Park and Royal Naval College.Please can there be a series two. Guy Ritchie is probably the best gangster film writer alive and we are very lucky to have him!",Absolutely brilliant
cloudstrife-03407,7,18 March 2024,You can tell Guy Ritchie only wrote (co-wrote) and directed the first two episodes as the show starts off with a crack and runs into a muddy and convoluted plot in episodes 5-7 and a fairly uncreative ending in episode 8.The show shines with the casting - primarily Kaya Scodelario as Susie Glass. Actually everyone is strong except for Theo James who I thought was miscast and would think he is a poor actor given his track record had it not been for White Lotus Season 2. I don't think he has found his acting niche yet but this isn't it.There are still Guy Ritchie vibes in the rest of the show after episode 2 and a fun and entertaining cast of characters. Messy plot in the back half and a little uncreative for Ritchie standards but a fun and high energy show.,Pretty Good But Can Tell Ritchie Only Wrote/Directed First Two Episodes
doycey,5,19 March 2024,"The early few episodes, particularly the first, are very clever and entertaining, however the formula very quickly becomes tedious as it is repeated and rehashed for every remaining episode. Some of the episodes are basically the same story, just told a different way with new characters.The ending is absolutely ridiculous and I can't believe Mr Ritchie actually thought it was a good way to finish the series.Ultimately it is worth a watch, the actors were mostly very good, the older brother in particular. The budget appears to have been capable of delivering the great show it fell short of. I'm not sure where all these 9 and 10 star ratings are coming from, but but it was good enough to keep me until the end.","Starts well, but repeats, then pales into mediocrity."
ssvfolder-1,9,9 March 2024,"I really like Guy Richie movies. He has had his fair share of less successful ones, but for the most part they were good.This time it's a TV show and a brilliant one at that. It feels like one of those movies, stretched over 8 episodes. It has a typical British dark humor moments, amazing setting (similar to a 2019 movie by the same name), good acting and great plot.You can't say that everything was perfect and the plot is ""fool proof"", but the style and the magic of Richie is more than makes up for it.I feel that it was one of the best decisions from Netflix in recent times, to hire Guy Richie and give him his creative freedom without too much interference from their part. He made it work and it shows.Absolutely advised for all!",Guy Richie does what he does best
krowe33,10,8 March 2024,"Not very often does a new television series come out that really draws you in like this series has me. I want to put it up there with Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Sopranos, and the other great series that have come out over the years, but time will tell if this one really stacks up to those series. If I were to compare season one of each though, so far The Gentlemen is looking like it will easily be one of my favorites.The first episode understsndably starts a little slow as we are introduced to the main characters, but by the end, it really draws you in. Each episode builds on the story and the relationships between the characters, and it just keeps getting better.I was initially worried about the deviation from the movie, with a completely new cast and perspective, but by episode two, I completely lost any concerns about that. This show holds its own against the movie in every way. That being said... I really hope there is a sequel to the movie. The movie is just begging to be a trilogy.If you liked the movie, you're gonna love this series. Don't go into it with the movie in mind though. Just watch this as a totally different take on the storyline of the movie. I really hope this one continues for many more seasons!",Breaking Bad The Guy Ritchie Version
Britsahil123,10,7 March 2024,"I couldn't stop binging this! It's a funny and wild ride with an ensemble cast. Theo James was born to play this role and I couldn't help thinking he would make a great Bond, especially after episode 2. Kaya Scodelario is brilliant as the steely Susie Glass. The comic timing of the whole cast is pivotal in making this so watchable.It's typical British dark humour and I can't wait to discover more jokes on repeat viewing. The locations are fantastic and are characters in themselves. I hope there are more seasons as I want to see how Eddie and Susie continue along with the characters who have survived this season!","Funny, brilliant and wild"
kunalpal-51722,9,9 March 2024,"Guy Ritchie's storytelling prowess has been celebrated by a certain segment of audience starting with Lock Stock or Snatch if not earlier.This one in some ways a sequel to The Gentlemen (Movie) but has a very fresh approach to that foundation. It starts a bit slow but picks up towards the second half of the first episode. Post that the way the subject is handled and the artistic depth with which it's showcased - it blows your mind. Personally, I couldn't stop before I finished the entire series and I cant wait for season 2.It has everything that you want from a Guy Ritchie Series and more. Quick shoutout to the cast specially Ray Winstone & Kaya Scodelario. I felt Theo James was good too and held the series tightly together along with other incredible actors.Series Binging completely recommended!",Masterpiece from Guy Ritchie
tacobelle30,10,25 March 2024,"I admit I was a little hesitant to watch 'The Gentlemen' on Netflix because I thought it was just a series of the film and thought it would be rubbish. But when I read the series was not a sequel to the film, I thought I'd give it a whirl... well what can I say? Once I started watching the first episode, I was hooked! To summarise in a nutshell, its British nobility meets the criminal underworld. It's fast-paced, action packed, full of twists and wit with a great soundtrack. Some characters I felt were similar to the film but then, the series was created by Guy Ritchie and all his films have some similarity to them in one way or another as in, they are his style of storytelling but I never tire of it. The acting and comic timing was spot on, Daniel Ings as Freddy Horniman is brilliantly annoying and the plot is wild but easy to follow.

danielleshaffi,7,15 March 2024,"I really enjoyed episode 1 to 6 of the show but by episode 7 and 8 I kind of lost interest in it.The show started off really fun with great humour. It was sort of ridiculous but in a good way, the type that is so ridiculous it turns out being funny. The whole ""all rich people are criminals"" really worked but it got a little desperate and rushed towards the end.In the last 2 episodes I just felt like it stopped being funny and silly and got really serious. They also really rushed the ending I think.. instead of having it all wrapped up in episode 8 they could have added the extra episode and had a really good, action packed ending.The John the Gospel story seemed like it was going to be rather interesting but I'm still not even sure what happened with that. It just burnt out rather fast. The end storyline with The Game Keeper as well (Vinny Jones) was so cliché it turned into being cringey.I probably will watch season 2 though because as a whole the show wasn't that bad and its definitely the best thing Netflix has made in a while.",The posh version of Brassic.
Jonas43106,10,12 March 2024,"Honestly started this series because I was bored and couldn't find anything to watch, but boy am I glad I stumbled upon this masterpiece. I liked the movie a lot! But the series feels a bit more bombastic; it's funny, tense, & dark. You must pay attention lest the plot - with many moving parts - will escape you! The dialogue really has that irreverent, guy ritchie pithy punch to it, but all its players nailed it. Kaya & daniel are amazing, but theo james grounds it & flexes his charisma & acting chops here.

catrinwalker,6,8 April 2024,"This was such a basic, cliched yet somehow unbelievable 'gangsta' show. I truly don't understand the fuss about this. It is absolutely nothing like the film and not a patch on other similar genred series (Top Boy for example). The constant repetition of names was so irritating and the characters just generally weren't believable. The one character I enjoyed and believed was Bobby Glass but otherwise, I couldn't wait for the show to end! I don't think we will even bother to watch the 2nd series if it's released.I also have to say this is the first proper review I've ever written on imdb but I couldn't let other people watch this without warning!",I don't get the fuss?
natashaedennison-91872,5,12 April 2024,"Terrible plot, very little relationship development, disappointing ending and no depth to the characters, one of those where the female characters are so blatantly written by men and the insincerity of the script and conversation wear thin very quickly. A lot of elements go unexplained including the relationship between the two main characters, there's also some irrelevance to the sub plot and the 'twists' if you can even call them that, as it is widely predictable, felt very lazy. I was looking forward to one big fight scene towards the end of the series and we weren't even given that. I'm genuinely shocked it has so many good reviews.",Wildly dissapointing
lakings97,9,20 March 2024,"The Gentlemen is a Guy Ritchie Netflix spin-off series based on his 2019 movie by the same that starred Matthew McConaughney. In this series Theo James plays Duke Eddie Hornman who ends up inheriting the family business and all its assets. After completing his duties in the military Eddie returns home to learn that his father has lent the farm to an illegal marijuana growing crime family. Eddie's older brother Freddy played by Daniel Ings had misused the family money to make horrible decisions that caused the Hornmans to work for Susie Glass (Kaya Scodelario). Kaya and Theo were both in the Divergent trilogy and they had great chemistry although they backstabbed each other throughout the series. Guy Ritchie co-wrote, created, and directed this fun, smart and excellent series and I am hoping to see a follow up season to this wonderful show that also has several references with the Godfather trilogy. Vinnie Jones, Michael Vu, Max Beasley costarred and Giancarlo Esposito acted as the American drug dealer trying to buy out the family business. Overall I loved the script, cast, and the cinematography, definitely add this to your must watch list.","Excellent, Great Series"
hollymike-87019,10,30 April 2024,"I was delightfully surprised by this series. It's not your run of the mill gratuitous sex and juvenile humor type thing, that is so common these days. It was snappy, gritty and you are taken on a true adventure. Very common of UK television, where they actually rely on the STORY to carry the program. It's a visual delight, as well. The filming locations are a wonder. The mansions and sets were opulant, toss in some exotic cars, horses, lots of great music. I loved the cast....they all worked so well together. The characters are people you will fall in love with and they'll stay with you. I can say now that I am a total Guy Ritchie fan. All I can hope and pray is that if there's a season 2, he doesn't muck it up and stays on track with what he did in the first season.",Excellent !

sim-bar,9,27 April 2024,"In the swirling currents of contemporary entertainment, a beacon of sophistication emerges in the form of Netflix's riveting series, ""The Gentlemen."" Steeped in the opulence of a bygone era, yet pulsating with the palpable rhythms of the modern age, this exquisite production conjures a realm where elegance and intrigue intertwine with masterful finesse.At the heart of this cinematic symphony lies the enigmatic figure of Wham Tam, a character as alluring as she is enigmatic. Inhabiting the ethereal space between reality and fantasy, Wham Tam transcends the confines of the screen, her presence an intoxicating elixir that ensnares the senses with a beguiling allure.It is in the delicate dance of desire that Wham Tam truly shines, her every movement imbued with a simmering eroticism that tantalizes and captivates in equal measure. With a glance, she ignites flames of passion that smolder beneath the surface, her aura suffused with an irresistible magnetism that beckons the viewer into her intoxicating embrace.Yet, beyond the allure of physical beauty, Wham Tam embodies a complexity that renders her a figure of profound fascination. Beneath the veneer of glamour lies a soul tormented by the shadows of the past, her journey a labyrinthine odyssey through the depths of desire and despair.The cinematography of ""The Gentlemen"" serves as a canvas upon which the story unfolds with breathtaking elegance. Each frame is a tableau of visual splendor, meticulously crafted to evoke the grandeur of a bygone era while remaining firmly rooted in the present. From the glittering ballrooms of high society to the dimly lit alleyways of the underworld, every scene is imbued with a richness of detail that transports the viewer into a world of unparalleled beauty and intrigue.The script, penned with a poet's grace and a playwright's precision, weaves a tapestry of intrigue and deception that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Dialogues crackle with wit and nuance, each word laden with meaning and subtext that adds depth to the characters and the world they inhabit.And yet, amidst the grandeur and the spectacle, it is the performance of the cast that truly elevates ""The Gentlemen"" to the realm of the sublime. Led by the luminous presence of Wham Tam, each actor brings their character to life with a level of commitment and authenticity that is nothing short of mesmerizing.In conclusion, ""The Gentlemen"" stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling to transport and enchant.

Although the episodes are still interesting enough once u begin to watch. Haven't seen the previous installment of Guy Ritchies work with the same name and don't even know if there is a connection or not but it never bothered me while I was onto it. The characters are interesting played well by respective actors(most of them if not all). The screenplay is decent enough and so is the direction. The problem I see in most of Netflix series is evident in this one also and that is the 'world building' problem, little details like Zero staff appearance at a massive property, a single person running a whole weed farm, lack of wide angle shots and additional actors obviously due to budget restraint.

mip_,,12 March 2024,"I was a big fan of both Lock Stock and Snatch when they initially came out and felt fresh and fun, but I haven't enjoyed Guy Ritchie's more recent work nearly as much.Having seen the trailer I was intrigued by this show. I sat through it all and there were exciting moments, but I didn't love it sadly. It felt hollow to me.This feels like Guy Ritchie's greatest hits rearranged and presented as a TV show. You will have seen most of the setup used here before, but this time many of the actors are different. Maybe that was my main issue with it, it didn't feel fresh and exciting, as it is a familiar format at this point and there is a risk of boredom setting in.It's undeniable that Ritchie knows his way around a camera. The show looks and sounds great. He has a great cast - Vinnie Jones is understated and quite excellent, but for me the story feels clunky, occasionally repetitive and surprisingly preposterous. In fact I found some of the dialogue to be cringe inducing. Some of it feels as though it had been intended to land as sophisticated and profound, but much of just sounds bad. This was never the case with some of his initial movies.I believe there is a much better show that could have been carved out of this with some stricter editing, as all of the pieces are there.

Watched in all in one night, I couldn't stop myself. Totally wild ride from start to finish. I found myself gasping in horror and laughing at the same time......Awesome, best show on Netflix hands down!! Theo was fantastic and the rest of the cast totally perfect. The pace i didn't find slow at all and I honestly can't understand any of (the very few) negative reviews, I have no idea what they think is a great show!!. Go on get it watched you won't be disappointed. Need more Theo James and more Guy Richie please.",Amazing
noamben-95217,10,7 March 2024,"And that's all I wanted in my life.If you love guy Ritchie films, you'll be amazed as usual with this show, it has it all - the dialogs, the cuts, the laughs, the english, the extreme fub and one and only Vinnie Jones.The show is energetic, fun to watch, quirky and intense at times and amazing cast, yeah it's early 2024 but it's one of the shows of the year with bo doboutThe fact that's the show released all the episodes at once really help you immerse yourself in Guy Ritchie style and have good ol' fun.To summarize - If you are a Guy Ritchie fan you'll have a blast watching the show, even if you aren't - it's definitely worth a try.",Basically a really long Guy Ritchie movie
donmanolo,10,8 March 2024,"Excellent work, everything goes surprisingly from gentle to aggressive with extraordinary balance and flow. What can I say, Guy Ritchie, he never disappoint us.I personally love the humor of Guy Ritchie and the perfect casting for all and each role, just amazing choices with great chemistry.Is another master piece of the amazing and love one Guy Ritchie, we owned him a big thank you and our respect for his contribution as an artist.We can't wait for more series because is something that we are not getting used too and it was an gift if we had more work from him to the promise future.Nobel work, well done for once more!",Magnificent!
purseofglitters,6,9 March 2024,"As said in the title, much of a fan of Mr. Ritchie's films. I was thrilled to hear about this project. Mr. Ritchie's format is well known. Charicature characters, witty stories embedded, pause and laugh format. All is well except perhaps the choice of lead. Mr. Theo James is an actor ,guaranteed to deliver same level of acting everytime. Joe Cole would've been a better choice. As delivering the same level of acting each time, over years, translates into average acting. Kaya on the other hand pleasantly surprised us by delivering more subtle impressions. Joely Richardson is pure class as expected. Max Beesely exceptional. Vine Beloved Jones quite forthcoming , Mr. Ray Winterson does what he does best. Was it Nigel playing as Tipsy?? Oh my that should be the very definition of superb acting
Attempted dry humour bit corny and forced.Delightful tweed jackets...so much appreciate the effort costume design. Also exceptional soundtrack and location.",Always been a great fan of Mr.Ritchie's flicks..but this is stretched far too long
cgvsluis,8,8 April 2024,"I love Theo James and tuned in strictly based on his starring role in this series...but I was even more pleasantly surprised to discover Guy Ritchie's touch. My family loves Guy Ritchie's work, particularly his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""...in fact my parents still refer to themselves as a certain type of horticulturist. Having said that this series started in a classic Guy Ritchie fashion...so you either love it or hate it. He has a particular colorful high flash style, with violence and comedy.Theo James plays Eddie Horniman, current U. N. soldier and soon to be Lord. He is sent home for the death of his father who passes over the eldest son Freddy to bestow the lordship on the more stable second son Eddie. It doesn't take long to discover why...and to discover where the Lord was getting large sums of money as we are introduced to Susie Glass.There are some great characters in this series, highlighted by a dramatic pause and typeset appearing across the screen Ritchie style. The series is short at eight episodes and after the first couple it settles down into a bit of a pattern involving identifying a problem, coming up with a solution to a problem, then being thrown a curveball, then having to get out of an even bigger problem.Flashy with good sets, costumes and music, I found the series highly enjoyable. It is loaded with comedy, but also drugs, foul language and lots of violence. I know it's not for everyone's tastes. However, If you are a big Guy Ritchie fan or a big Theo James fan, I can highly recommend the series.I do like the unexpected and the chicken scene, which seemed to be going on an inordinately long time ends in an unexpected surprise...so I would like to say that I disliked the scene and that it was unnecessary...but then you would have missed the surprise.","Not for the faint of heart, but loaded with comedy and great characters, the pairing of Theo James and Guy Ritchie is gold."
martinirossel,6,10 March 2024,"It is a bit funny, but highly ridiculous as well.Guy Ritchie goes down his old rabbit hole of making an entertaining fantasy about criminality, but the plot here is more of a stupid joke.A UK nobleman who inherits the lot, and who is also portrayed as a smart and quite sinister ex military lets himself be drawn into any stupid
crime moniker for the fun of it.. But for it to be really fun and exciting it would have to be a slight bit more realistic. Not that Ritchie´s capers ever were, and that's fine - but this one is uncredible to the point of meaninglessness. Soggy opium for the people.The actors are good, and there´s a couple of great characters too, also in line with the Ritchie playbook. But here´s not that many turning points or surprises. It´s a bit of a Breaking Bad for the English aristocracy (already quite badly broken I guess) but once you're on the trail of gentleman thievery nothing much develops.",Guy Ritchie stuff
4u4o,5,15 March 2024,"Oh, look, few Guy Ritchie movies in one. After losing his mojo during his Madonna period, which is completely understandable, he has probably spent countless nights thinking how he can recycle all his movies for some buck. I guess that period was expensive and all. And this show is exactly that. Recycled material. However. Things have quite changed in the last 20 years. And as there might still be hunger for an ole British action comedy, this one comes tad short of being a success. All the cliches are in place, plus few new ones. And as you hit midseason, you realize they don't tie up very well and plot holes start growing bigger. Thus, I don't understand the bloated rating. Yes, it starts all right and is kinda fun for a while, then turns into a bloody mess with plot twists that are put there for the sake of filling up couple more episodes. The finale... I won't even bother. It was a joke, made with the only purpose to leave season two door open.",Passable at best
Tww60551,10,10 March 2024,"It's had some bad reviews, but I loved it. Yes, not the best that Guy Richie has brought us, but it's silly, fun and entertaining. I think the cast are fantastic. In particular Ray Winstone, Vinny Jones, and the dude that plays the brother. I have also read some reviews that the guy that plays the Captain was wooden. In my opinion he played the part really well coming from his background and Army situation, calm and collected. I am hoping for series 2 and if this happens, Mr Richie needs to bring it up a nottch, with lots more antics, and a lot more of Ray Winstone. Totally recommend to any fan of Guy Richie.",Absolutely loved it!
michela-65272,10,9 March 2024,"Absolutely brilliant. In my top 3 of series seen this year so far. The usual excellent individual character development and story telling that we see in all of Guy Richie's works, that is super complex but you never feel lost at any point of the story and that's a skill that no one comes close to mastering as Guy does. Beautifully shot, I love the lighting, feels so cinematic like you're watching a movie in every episode. And love the cast. So well ensambled. I hadn't read or seen a trailer before so I didn't know Giancarlo Esposito was in it too, that was a welcomed surprise! I'll finish with saying, can they please make Theo James the next 007already?!",Brilliant!
clairerevermann,10,10 March 2024,"Loved the series. So many twists and turns and written for the intelligent audience.The characters are amazing. It's almost Tarantino like but without or the unneeded violence. However, the violence is definitely there, just not over done.Loved it. Watch and enjoy. You won't regret. It's funny, unique, smart, clever and very entertaining. It has moments of fantasy.Netflix haven't had anything good for a long time. I so happy to see they are picking up tv worthy series again. They definitely didn't go wrong with this one. I hope this is a sign of good things to come.Enjoy and demand more!!",Brilliant and intelligent
paul-33497,10,28 April 2024,"I came to this having not seen the film that inspired it, so was in the dark, except for being familiar with Guy Ritchie's style. Talking of Dark, I've just waded through that unintelligible pile of poop - and would happily trade the entire three seasons for 10 seconds of The Gentlemen! Very darkly comic, with superb performances by all the cast - the 'chicken' episode is a particular standout - tragic, brutal and hilarious! I wasn't a great Vinnie Jones fan, from his thuggish football playing days - but he's turned into a fine actor. Here, he plays against type, in some particularly moving scenes. I sincerely hope that this gets recommissioned!",Splendid!
jaredkeahey,8,10 March 2024,"There is so much magic and insane amazingness in this show. There are so many high points and moments and feelings, but I really want to home in on Daniel Ings. What a character LOL! What a portrayal!! Recognized his face instantly from the first season of The Crown. He was strong in his supporting role, but this is something else entirely!! His commitment to... Whatever we can call Freddy lol... is brilliant. He nails this ridiculous idiot and drives home the insane, coked out, jealous brother perfectly. From head to toe, eyes to nose, he looks SO strung out and really adds to this absolutely moronic, yet amazing character. It's a full package level of commitment to a character that really elevates an already amazing show. The shot of him on the 4wheeler, on the hunt, vape in mouth, eyes blood shot, chicken suit intact... LOL. Unreal shot. To anyone who likes crime comedies and ridiculous stuff that works, watch this show. And enjoy the hell out of the annoying, yet brilliant, Freddy Horniman xD.",Daniel Ings as Freddy Horniman
scott-895-207665,9,28 March 2024,"A must see for fans of the Ozarks Series, ""The Gentleman"" series brings an humorous English flare to the genre of suspense storytelling.Delightfully entertaining and far from cliché, the story transitions from one challenge to another with an almost graceful humor - albeit amidst gangsters and gypsies, kingpins and kush, castles and cows.Just like the Ozark storyline, your assumptions will blind you to the character's next predicament.

jeroendewilde-1,6,23 March 2024,"My first review ever, triggered by the insane current rating of 8.4. Where does that come from?!The storyline is not as strong as Guy Ritchies earlier works.The dialogues are not as classic as his earlier works.Acting is OK, but nothing memorable like in his earlier works as well.The overall project is good, but not even as good as ""The Gentleman"" it has spun of off. And that, in itself, was already a bit less than Guy Ritchies earlier work.Honestly, how does this series get the rating it currently does.To be clear it's still better than 90% of other series on Netflix and streaming services. I actually do recommend it. But a. 8.4 just blows my mind.","Fun, but much overrated - no comparison with GR earlier classics"
mofs12,10,8 March 2024,"Guy Ritchie has grown out of his madcap frenetic ways and delivered a piece of more mature and refied quality. It may not be as shock inducing or bombastic as his film offerings, but it is all the better for it. I was sad to leave this world whe the last episode ended. Always a good sign. It's stylish and very pleasant to watch. Excellent dialogues, great cast ensemble, and a perfect combination of class and crass, as usual with Guy Ritchie. For those who enjoy the director (as I do), you will immediatly identify his universe: gentlemen and bad boys, taken in the same spiral of darkness and doom.","Brilliant, fun, impressive show!!"
hughhargreaves,,8 March 2024,"Really refreshing, just a great watch! I binged the whole lot in one go. Don't judge. Kaya lost her accent very quickly, but the characters were brilliant.Great seeing Vinnie being a different sort of character than he normally is. It is a Guy Ritchie series through and through. Full of little surprises!Really in my opinion very enjoyable, and watchable to the extreme. If you love lock stock and also snatch, the film ""the gentlemen"" included. You will love this, as long as you love long format.Actors fantastic, writing is amazing, the Netflixness is minimal, just generally a good Guy Ritchie series that needs no Madonna.",Great
dylangifford,7,17 April 2024,"The first few episodes start off with a bang. Throughout the season, it starts to build onto something pretty decent, then somewhere along the line, it kind of just stops progressing. The last couple episodes left a lot to be desired, and feel the way the season finale ended, that it was a very safe plot to write. They didn't show much risk by the writing. I enjoyed the constant shenanigans that they played with one another. I didn't feel they were gangster enough to be as threatening as they made it sound like.Would have given this show a 9 or 10, but due to the way it ended, it gets a solid 7, only because the great start.",Great start...poopy ending!!
Xavier_Stone,4,8 March 2024,"Guy Ritchie can do some good films, but this is just drawn out twists and turns in which characters don't seem to make any sense. They're angry, betrayed then 20 mins later everything is forgiven only to be betrayed 10 mins later and repeat.It gets old fast. The last few episodes are annoying at best with the ending being absolute garbage. The actors are decent enough but the scenes are just terrible and the entire plot/story is just not that entertaining.So much promise after the pilot episode, but it just gets worse and worse with the audience mostly shaking their heads at the steps along the way. 4/10. Could have been done so much better with the budget and actors involved. Seems like it was a movie that was stretched out to 8 episodes of 40 minutes each. Tons of filler.",Rather dissapointing the more it goes on
youssefmostafa-58182,10,8 March 2024,"Absolutely brilliant, finished the whole season in 13 hours. It hooks you up very well from the first episode the duo between Theo James and Susie Glass is Golden, the directing from Guy Ritchie is peak Guy Ritchie. Every side character is very well designed as if it was a main character. I bet that the show could have been seen from the perspective of 90% percent of the side characters and it would still hold up great, but stick with the Edward and Susie duo though, This show could develop into something great if it's given more seasons so hopefully it will be renewed as i would love to see how the characters develop and especially the relationship between the new business partners The duke, and Susie, and it MUST be renewed we just started so why end it now while it still didn't mature.","Breaking Bad but More brilliant, witty, and stylish"

Forget all your mega huge budget highly hyped sci-fy - super hero fantasy and along with the retelling of much loved novels and comics that leave a bitter taste in even the actors mouths. While this may be a nonsensical story line, it is brilliant in its imagination and scripting that leaves you wanting more of the same.The laughs are plentiful and there is so much chemistry between the leading roles it hints of a budding Romeo and Juliet romance that needs to be explored in future seasons.Although you can guess the type of character Vinnie Jones will be playing he does put in his best performance to date. There are few actors who could make the role he plays work.All in all a excellent series that sets the groundwork for future episodes --- should the Lord of Netflix allow.","The movie was good, however, this is much better"

MadAboutTheHouse,9,10 March 2024,"The Gentlemen (2024): A Ritchie romp worth revisitingGuy Ritchie returns to the world he crafted in his 2019 film ""The Gentlemen,"" but this time for the small screen. This Netflix series delivers a fresh take on the gritty London underworld, packed with Ritchie's signature style.**Stepping into the Game:**Theo James takes the lead as Eddie Horniman, an aristocrat who inherits a family estate - unaware it houses a thriving cannabis operation run by the cunning Bobby Glass (Ray Winstone). When Eddie tries to sell the estate, a tangled web of gangsters, investigators, and double-crosses unfolds.**Classic Ritchie Flavors:**Fans of Ritchie's films will find themselves right at home. Fast-paced dialogue, sharp wit, and intricate plotting drive the narrative. The series doesn't shy away from violence, but it's delivered with a darkly comedic flair. The soundtrack is another win, perfectly complementing the on-screen action.**New Faces, Fresh Story:**While the series shares its title with the film, it's not a straight adaptation. New characters and a unique storyline keep things engaging. Theo James brings a youthful charm to Eddie, and Kaya Scodelario shines as Bobby's ruthless daughter Susie. The ensemble cast delivers strong performances, adding depth to the criminal underworld.**A Touch of Deja Vu?**The series might feel a bit familiar to those who loved the film. Ritchie's style is distinct, and some plot elements echo the film's themes. However, the extended format allows for richer character development and deeper exploration of the criminal underbelly.**Overall:**""The Gentlemen"" is a stylish and entertaining crime drama. Newcomers to Ritchie's world will be hooked, while fans will find a worthy successor to the original film.

tm-sheehan,7,13 March 2024,"My Review- The Gentlemen
Netflix series 7./10The Gentlemen is a spin off series from a 2019 movie written by its creator Guy Ritchie which I found entertaining but I enjoyed the original movie more giving it an 8.5 /10.The concept is basically the same as it's a satire on the problems that the British aristocracy have when they inherit titles and property but can't maintain the upkeep of their stately homes and must improvise.The eight part series is no where near as humorous as the 2019 movie and that's ok because it's different enough to be worth watching.This time instead of the crazy Fletcher character played brilliantly in the movie by Hugh Grant we have Daniel Ings as Freddie Horniman the heir apparent to the Halstead estate . He's a buffoon and an idiot so it's not surprising when his dying father Archibald Horniman played by Edward Fox in possibly his briefest role ever leaves the
the estate of 15,000 acres and the title of Duke of Halstead to his second son Eddie played by Theo James.From then on Theo James holds this series together, he's excellent when recovering from the hysteria of his brother Freddie at losing his inheritance discovers that his father was complicit in a huge illegal coverup.The family estate was host to a weed-growing empire run by Bobby Glass played by Ray Winstone.Eddie Horniman now the new Duke of Halstead ,a far cry from his previous career as a United Nations Peacekeeping Officer
must navigate a world of eclectic and dangerous characters with nefarious agendas, while also trying to protect his home and stay alive.That's the story but for me the series lacked the humour and originality of the original movie.There's some great performances in the series I enjoyed Kaya Scodelario as Susie Glass the ruthless daughter of Bobby Glass the head of the drug syndicate who runs his crime empire from prison.Eddie and Susie have some great scenes together as he tries to free the family estate from the shackles of the crime lords.",Entertaining but the movie is better
maazahmad77,8,7 March 2024,"Two episodes in, this series seems to be significantly mellower and slower-paced than your usual Guy Ritchie movie, including the namesake of this series, namely the 2019 movie The Gentlemen, also directed by Guy Ritchie.If you've enjoyed The Gentlemen (the movie) and other Guy Ritchie movies, but found them a little over the top and chaotic, but love the mood, the setting and the characters, then this series is right up your alley. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, great production and an engaging story is what you get in this expansion of The Gentlemen-universe.You'll also find some familiar faces among quite the gallery of new characters, one in particular was a very pleasant surprise.

resale-56736,,7 March 2024,"""The Gentlemen"" manages to expand the universe of the film without losing the essence that made it so captivating. It's a delicate balance to strike, but the series navigates it with finesse, paying homage to the original while charting its own course.The series also improves on the film and it's critiques through expanded characters, the erasure of any stereotypical/racial insensitivies, the introduction of a badass fully formed female character, as well as adding some heart to the story.The series confirms that the world Ritchie created has much more to offer, and I, for one, am here for every twist, turn, character reveal and witty retort it brings.",Good ol' ***** fun
schatel,7,19 March 2024,"All fairly entertaining, all fairly predictable, and clichéd to a fault. The premise is promising, the two main protagonists are engaging, and the first two episodes directed by Guy Ritchie set the scene well enough. Sadly after that the series rambles, it probably could have done with being a couple of episodes shorter amongst other things; and by the time the last episode rolls around with its inevitably contrived happy conclusion all you can do is roll your eyes and hope this doesn't get greenlit for a second season, this was plenty and certainly doesn't merit any further exploration. 6.5/10 mostly for the premise and the cinematography.",Strangely limp

That was the bar in which this is being judged upon.The acting is surprising good, I can't knock some half decent performances, the issue really is the script itself, The movie focused on introducing the different factions, all unique, all memorable, all likable and made them intertwine by the closing credits. They all had their quirks, strengths, weaknesses, personalities & that's why the movie was so intelligently made.This follows, more so, a bunch of privileged posh people trying to negotiate millions of pounds as if it was a few quid, it's slow, it's rigid, it's forgettable, it's like a false version and no amount of profanities thrown in to emulate the movie is going to cut it.For those rating so highly, I suggest you watch the original movie once more, remind yourself what the premise was and how well it portrayed it, come back & re-evaluate the rating for this poor, sell out imitation.",The Gentlemen movie...if ordered on Wish.

I looked forward to seeing her every few seconds. Most of them episodes are written so beautifully except perhaps episode 4,5 but that's because it was setting up for rollercoaster ahead.

And Theo (who I never thought was a great actor) had to compete with stellar lead role of Matthew McCounaghay (however his name is spelled). Being so I didn't expect much. Once I found out Guy Ritchie was still involved I got excited. Once I found out it wasn't an extension or reimagined version of the movie I was a little more excited. However I was still nervous because of the lead character.Theo style was debonair & classic with a hint of gangster. Only negative Stanley Johnston still felt like the bad guy in Mandalorian.

The irony and the shade was not lost on me as Belinda and that very song was sung and then pointed out as an extreme irritant for a certain Queen of Pop whom the director may or may not (but probably did) possibly maybe be throwing a dig at.

Idle_Hands08,6,7 March 2024,"Interesting to see Guy Ritchie expand this world into a series... The feature film was generally well liked athough not in the same league as Lockstock or Snatch. There's no doubting his writing of key characters and often snappy dialogue, and the good thing here is that the narrative seems to be off to a good start in ep. 1...The pacing might be an issue going forward but time well tell as the episodes continue. It looks great on the screen, together with the settings, the intertwining stories and key players vying for money and a seat at the head of the table... Would be good to see more action and pending doom that the characters need to escape or work around... But that's just episode 1... So...And Vinnie Jones is back...

The strong leads are supported by many familiar faces, the dialogue is typically smart 'n witty and the whole thing holds together well, keeping this viewer more than interested in seeing how each episodic ""situation"" plays out and how each ""problem"" is resolved - so to speak!Recommended.",Excellent expansion on the original film...
austenhaines1,7,8 March 2024,"Yes. It's Guy Ritchie, and yes you get all that comes with a Ritchie film. But the casting falls short. I was looking for ruthless, and I got schoolyard fighting. I was looking for a good London gangster accent, and I got Kaya Scodelario trying sooo hard to sound less educated than she is. She fails. She isn't mean, she isn't tough, she isn't sexy, and she most definitely isn't the daughter of a gangster. Story is fine, and everything is fine and enjoyable, but it feels like it's been made for people who are a little over sensitive. It's played a little too safe for a Ritchie series. Close, but no cigar.","Close, but no cigar"
carmenpatruc,5,12 March 2024,"The film opens with the first two episodes very good and very interesting, making you curious to find out what's next. Unfortunately all the interest is lost along the way because of the forced and drawn out story, it becomes very boring and it is very clear that it is forced to reach the number of episodes initially thought. It was so interesting that I didn't even remember its ending, or it didn't really have an ending. Maybe just the place left for a next season. The original movie is many classes over, it has absolutely nothing to do with it anyway. Only the underground business that the protagonist inherits is done in the same way as in the inspirational film. Good start, gets lost along the way.","Good start, gets lost along the way."
djgmac-65158,10,9 March 2024,"I would consider this a new masterpiece if you appreciate the genius of Lock, Stock, and like me you are somewhat partial to the English Gangster genre with a well placed comedic edge. That captures your attention from the beginning (fast paced) plus a sublime script delivered by near perfect casting. Then you should clear yourself a weekend as you have to binge watch this. Being a bit of a pessimist! I normal look for the faults. Unfortunately I didn't really any. On a final note I really hope that Netflix commission a second season, as of late, most of the new content hasn't really made me laugh, smile, laugh and totally engaged like this did 😊 10/10.....",A return to Guy Richie's absolute best 😊
striklix,8,9 May 2024,"This is such a fun time man, easily one of the most purely entertaining and enjoyable shows I have watched so far this year and I pretty much adored every second of it. The actual plot itself is fairly intriguing right off the bat and while not being something super inventive or anything it does a really good job at grasping attention and keeping the viewer hooked for its entire eight episode run time. This also tends to share a lot with the movie by Guy Ritchie of the exact same name (and I presume in the same universe as well), they both involve the dealings of weed, and they are both inherently hilarious while still having a ton of serious and emotional moments that really flesh out its story and the characters within it. Paired with some excellent acting from every actor involved here that ranges from making me sad, happy, excited, or just downright upset, some very talented people at work here and they really bring together this show. Combined with an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that is to be expected from something made by Ritchie, and some really stellar direction from both Ritchie and those who directed the other episodes, this is at the very least an immensely entertaining time that is short and sweet for a show. I highly recommend checking it out for yourself if you have Netflix as it is more than worth the time investment here, and if you have liked any other Guy Ritchie projects, most notably the other ""The Gentlemen"", I have a strong feeling you'll enjoy this one as well as they share a lot of the same endearing traits. Peak type show for real.","""Spoken, like a true gentlemen."""
twinsstyle,10,19 March 2024,"I absolutely loved this show and look forward to Season 2. Theo James and Giancarlo Esposito are fantastic. I can't imagine anyone else playing Eddie better than Theo James and his lunatic brother Freddie played by Daniel Inges. Vinny Jones as Geoff is wonderful also. Writing is tight, humor is on point. I have not enjoyed a tv series this much since Breaking Bad. The show is a balanced nuance of the difficult choice for a righteous duke that find himself at the center of a massive crime syndicate on his new inheritate lands. The character growth of the duke and the flirtatious partnership with ms. Susie Glass without the flirtation being at the center of the show, makes it exciting without the romance filling up too much. In my personal opinion this is one of the greatest TV-shows that Guy Ritchie have created. Sublime cast and great narrative for the story. 10/10 would watch a season 2.",One of best Netflix shows in recent years
ligiv-05164,10,19 March 2024,"The Gentlemen Season 1 - This show marks a remarkable debut for Guy Ritchie in the realm of television, proving his prowess extends beyond the silver screen. With a stellar ensemble cast and a storyline that deftly expands upon the rich world of the original movie, each episode unfolds as a masterclass in storytelling. While some moments, like the absurd chicken scene in the opener and the resolution of the finale, may have tested patience slightly, the overall narrative arc is a captivating journey through the underbelly of British crime. What sets this series apart is its ability to weave multiple subplots seamlessly, all converging towards a satisfying conclusion. The relentless action keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, while the high production value ensures a cinematic experience throughout. Theo James and Kaya Scodelario shine brightly, with James's portrayal of a British gangster being a standout performance that adds depth and authenticity to the narrative. As the series unfolds, it feels less like episodic television and more like an extended cinematic experience, with each episode building upon the last to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. The finale leaves tantalizing threads for a potential second season, hinting at even more intrigue and excitement to come. This is a must watch for fans of crime dramas, offering a thrilling ride filled with twists, turns, and standout performances.

martingreen-71835,9,10 March 2024,"A simply outstanding new series from Guy Ritchie, who has done it yet again.This series will keep you hooked from the very first episode to the last. The plot, characters and the actors come together to deliver a truly enjoyable story.Yes Guy Ritchie has his own style, which is all over this series, but his style delivers everything you will ever need, including comedy, drama, violence and a hint of romance thrown in there too.The acting is very good, and you will see a number of old favourites in here, like Ray Winstone and Vinnie Jones, but there are so many other talented actors its difficult to say who is the star. I would personally say Vinnie Jones as the gamekeeper, and Pearce Quigley as Gospel John were my favourites.This series comes to a natural conclusion in the final episode, but I like many really hope there will be a second series of The Gentlemen in the pipeline.Watch it now.",Guy Ritchie at his best

What is it with creating the same crap storyline time and time again, its always the same cookie-cutter main actor who acts exactly how you would expect him to act... Always the same pretentious loser bravado. To be honest I liked almost every actor so not sure who decided to pick this loser. Honestly, the writers are a joke, so scared to deviate from mainstream garbage. This is why we so rarely get incredible characters like 95% of the cast of GOT. Grow some balls and write something unique. How this garbage got more than 8 stars is beyond me. Just another unfunny.

galvas,7,8 March 2024,"An entertaining ride with the charismatic cast, but the one where one needs to switch off their brains and forget about logic or realism. Guy Ritchie sprinkled his gangsters world with some dazzlers and pinky dust peppered with xenophobia and cliche to ensure that the product sells well, but at the end it lacks substance to become something watchable more than once. Memorable Jethro's episode though. But, come on, protagonists shipping the main witness over several days or supposedly selling the idea of someone using the same riffle to kill twice across the city and carrying this huge gun across the street and into high rise and then back to the car etc...",Gangster fairy tale
fealgu,4,9 March 2024,"Guy Ritchie's signature brand of frenetic crime comedy gets a half-hearted adaptation in ""The Gentlemen"" TV series. While it captures the director's fondness for fast cuts and a splashy underworld, the format struggles to sustain the frenetic energy that worked for Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.The story follows a newly minted Duke who inherits a family estate, only to discover a hidden marijuana operation. Thrust into the criminal world, he must navigate shady characters and rescue his bumbling brother from a local gang's clutches. However, the series falls into a repetitive cycle of rescue missions, lacking the clever twists and unexpected turns that make a tv series entertaining.While classic Ritchie capers often feature inept and bumbling criminals, ""The Gentlemen"" doesn't fully utilize this comedic potential or tries to renew this form comedic relief. The constant rescue missions of his inept brother feels like a retread, leaving viewers with a sense of ""seen it before"", and ""there we go again."" Ultimately, the show prioritizes style over substance, relying on flash over fresh ideas. And I might add, this is an old style.In short, ""The Gentlemen"" joins the ranks of forgettable crime comedies, failing to deliver the innovative approach or memorable characters that would truly set it apart.",The Gentle-meh

This show is an absolute blockbuster, a cinematic marvel translated to the small screen. Its storytelling prowess is unparalleled, each frame meticulously crafted to deliver an electrifying performance that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. With every episode, it meets the high standard set by its movie predecessor. This is not just a show, it's a cinematic experience redefined for television, setting a new standard for small screen greatness.

domagojomrcena,10,7 March 2024,"Funny, entertaining and brilliant. From the first episode you could tell the masterpiece of Guy Ritchie! Recommend everyone! I watched the movie in 2019. Also it was very fun and fresh in that moment. When the series was shown to the world, I was a little skeptic about where will the story go. As I said, from the first to the last episode, you are on your feet waiting for another twist and entertainment. In my opininion, show is for absolutely everyone because your mood goes up, not down, just by watching it. The story is great, acting is great and the whole setup is just fantastic. Always been a fan of Ritchie, this was just confirmation why was that.",Brilliant!
BrianQuinn81,10,22 March 2024,I don't understand any negative reviews on this. I went in with a pessimistic mindset but was hooked and enjoyed every second of it. Each episode became increasingly more interesting and tied together very well. I highly recommend. If you saw the movie I wouldn't associate it too much with the show. This was much better. The lead actor and actress were familiar faces that I didn't expect much from initially but they were absolutely perfect for the roles. There were also familiar faces in the supporting roles that fit well. Definitely give it a try. Of all the things I've watched this year this was up with the best of them.,Surprisingly intriguing. Loved it.

mo94462,10,9 March 2024,"The story ranks alongside Guy Ritchie's best and most entertaining work. It's great to see the Ritchie story-telling style spread across an 8-episode season, and it works well in this longer format. There's more time to really get to know the main characters, and there's more room to develop a broader range of gangland characters. A thoroughly bingeable Ritche romp. The series is unhinged in the best way. Cast is brilliant. Even without romance the chemistry between Theo James and Kaya Scodelario is off the charts. The final episode wraps up nicely but I still think there's room for more.10/10.","Wow, what did I just watch!!"

There are crazy aged aristocrats with machine guns shooting at busloads of tourists. There are fistfights, gunfights, knife-fights, explosions, intentional and accidental and near- murders, a just-enough-but-not-too-much amount of gore, and a palate-cleansing sprinkling of love interest.

The Gentlemen is pretty much a formula work, and hers a complimentary fit... not acting as much as filling a role that doesn't change-require-much, at least through the first several episodes watched... her partner in this caper Theo James, now forty years old appears younger, looking nearer her age than his own... they both do well together, and this all could continue on into another season, but according to sites like Next Episode it has been 'canceled/ended'.. oh well, remaining episodes to be watched need-might give a clue as to its apparent early-demise.","... watch two episodes, then decide if to continue"

vovazg,10,17 March 2024,"When it comes to shows following the movies and vice versa rarely it happens that they manage to hit the right spots other than milk the cow goal. Being a long time admirer of Guy Ritchie he basically never disappoints at least when it comes to stories told in a Guy Ritchie England universe. It's Gentlemen world but each episode stands for it self while a main story develops throughout the first season. In that way we are introduced with all kinds of specific Guy Ritchie type of characters that are the antagonists of that episode which I find refreshing and there are no filler episodes. The new cast doesn't need a lot of time for introduction. Due to a specific Guy Ritchie type of dialogs they go quickly under your skin and it's really well picked cast. Theo James gave his best performance in the White lotus second season and he's really natural in playing posh, high class society that no wonder people are calling for him being a candidate for new James Bond. It's not the snobbish class vibe but the raw and ordinary combined with the world of the rich that comes out of him. If Theo is 40% then Kaya Scodelario is the other 40% of the show. And the all kinds of characters make the remaining 20% for a full on lively and colorful spectrum of the story. One of my biggest joys is to see the always remarkable Vinnie Jones that has that stealing the screen presence and it wouldn't be the same without him. One of the best things aside of the rural English scenery, music and the yellow font prologue announcement is the flashback storytelling by various characters describing what happened to them rather than seeing it in one take continuity. Altogether this is one of the Netflix best shows by far and it might not be a perfect 10 (and why should something be perfect anyway?) but I give it that score just to add a tiny bit of my contribution to point out how the shows should look like. It's a rare and endangered species this one and that's why is a treasure.",Rate it a 10 just because we are desperate for more of these kind of entertainments

A fabulous mixture of criminal activities and aristocracy, this series perfectly managed to mix and blend those two worlds together seamlessly, as though they were always meant to be one.The cast is outstanding! Literally every single character was fantastically well written and acted, making you truly believe the nuances and complexities of each person and their relationships with each other, without it needing to be explicitly touched on. Very clever.This series is everything you would come to expect from something affiliated with Guy Ritchie, it's classic, timeless, violent, graphic and tells a gripping story.Highly recommend watching this.

Bravo Theo.Nice to see our beloved crock / zombie fighting Kaya back in action she has never let us down with her amazing talents.Once again Guy has delivered a 10 out of 10 show.I have watched The Gentleman film 4 times and when I heard there was a TV show I thought it was going to have to be amazing in order to top the film, well it is.

Pequod88,9,27 March 2024,"Very entertaining. Quite satisfying. Well cast with a strong mix of action, tension, witty banter, and suspense. Theo James avoids the pitfalls of the role, not playing Eddie as too macho, preening, or invulnerable. Kaya Scodelario is a perfect co-star: smart, cool, and calculating, while not at all above the fray.While the series loses a little steam as it pivots to wrapping up in the final two episodes, there is a ton to like and only a few quibbles. Pleased that it avoided leaning too hard on Eddie getting Freddy out of jams. Vinnie Jones does a lot with a softer role possessing more colors than usual. The smoldering chemistry with Joley Richardson is a welcome thread. The mayhem and eye candy one expects from Ritchie are present, of course, and I am eager for more.While the checking of boxes and setting up for season two drained a bit of spark late in the proceedings, I am on board. The notion of Ray Winstone and Giancarlo Esposito holding forth at the ""pigeon porch"" alone will be worth the price of admission. Eddie and Susie will simmer and spark before the fire rages. Susie may be the smartest woman to ever grace a Ritchie project. More, more, more! Enthusiastically recommended.",Sign Me Up for Season Two
colinlairdcampbell,7,8 March 2024,"While this is a very watchable series and the cast is pretty good it is a bit of a let down.The predictable ineptitude of many of the characters is shallow and not worthy of a British series, I expect better and this series fails to delivery on many levels.This becomes obvious in episodes 2 & 3. I have not seen episode 4 yet, but predict that Mr. Johnston (with a T) is behind the hijacking of the dope shipment. He will of course cause more mayhem in coming episodes that of course will lead to yet more incompetence from the Dukes brother and associates. One can hope that this series will develop into something a bit more deep, but alas the premise of the whole series seems to be built around the duke saving the day each episode.There seems to be a plotline being built around the duke getting out of the game and I feel he will try but alas never be fully able to break the chains of criminality that have developed around him.I wish him the best and watch the rest of the series with further anticipation that will fail to be met.It is a good watch all the same considering the lack of competition in English speaking dramas of any type on any media these days.So after all that it is still a good watch and anyone who likes humour in drama just a bit will enjoy this series, I think.","Entertaining, but predictable"

I've binge watched it now multiple times and it's still hilarious, gruesome and action packed with great characters . I liked it better than the movie because there's more time for complex and layered plot elements to develop and unfold. It's a very fun and engaging watch.

berestov,6,11 March 2024,"There is little connection with the 2020 film of the same name.Guy Ritchie directed the first 2 episodes himself and wrote the script for the entire season.It looks secondary, because the Guy Ritchie-style series has been coming out for a long time: BrassikIn principle, you can limit yourself to two episodes, because then the series look like fillers that are little connected to each other. The characters do not have any global problem in the course of the plot.The main role that went to someone from the Divergent trilogy is annoying at first, but then you get used to it and you even seem to believe the acting.This is Guy Ritchie's worst work since the wonderful film Swept Away, because it's impossible to fall below that level.","Guy Ritchie tried again to shoot something in the style of Guy Ritchie, but it didn't work out"
simondmfisher,2,15 March 2024,"Representative of what is becoming standard Netflix output; expensive and lavish production with nothing beneath the veneer.Half decent acting, but pointless - one dimensional - characters.Cliches abound; upper class thickos and ne'er do wells (never without a glass of whisky in their hands) wall to wall 'Mockney' gangsters (Ray Winstone is going to get himself typecast if he's not careful) bumbling stoners (is anyone really that stupid) 'travelers' who steal things (but are really salt of the earth) and a variety of villainous 'Scousers' (I really like Pearce Quigley, but his accent seemed to veer from one end of the East Lancs Road, to the other) Romanians (heavily tattooed obvs) and others (I think there were Columbians and Belgians in there somewhere too).It was almost as if Ritchie had started out with a tick list; Drug dealers? Check. Boxing gym/fights/promoter? Check, check, check. Lots of brown alcohol in expensive glasses? Check. Bent prison system? Check.The list is yawningly endless.Look, I know it's just a story, but are there really people in the UK who EXPORT drugs to the continent? Really? They ship drugs to a bigger landmass, with a better climate for growing weed - and they can do this cheaper?By the way, who was in charge of continuity? One minute it's winter, then summer, then winter, then spring, then winter.

grimmfilment,9,30 March 2024,"Guy Ritchie is as unique a filmaker as they come. His style of writing and directing is easily recognized, kind of like the writing and directing of Tarantino. Just like you know when you're watching a Tarantino movie, you also know when you're watching a Ritchie movie. The plot, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, it's all there.The Gentlemen is no exception. It perfectly fits with the rest of Ritchie's top work in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, RocknRolla and The Gentlemen, the movie. The Gentlemen, the movie, combined Ritchie's style with McConaughey presence and in the process created something that inspired this show. Luckily, Ritchie is not one of the derivative lot, he doesn't take his own good idea and then stretches them like plenty of movie makers do when they get a chance to serialize their work.This iteration of the Gentlemen follows Eddie Horniman, a United Nations peacekeeping officer and the younger son of the Duke of Halstead. After the death of his father, Eddie surprisingly inherits the title of Duke over his older brother, who has a bit of a cocaine problem, and the entire Halstead estate. He is soon approached by Susan Glass, the de facto head of Glass' criminal syndicate, played quite well by Kaya Scodelario. Susan reveals to Eddie that her enterprise had a deal with his late father in the form of an underground marijuana farm colcealed on his estate. Susan grows and sells the weed, Eddie gets a cut, everyone happy.The show kicks off from the start and never lets off. It is jam packed with Ritchie's usually colorful characters and their various quirks. Theo James, usually stuck playing eye candy characters, shines as the Duke of Halstead. He has the looks and demeanor of an aristocrat but the competence to navigate the world he's been thrown into somewhat unwillingly. Kaya Scodelario also shines as Susan Glass. He talent was never in question but she plays the role of a daughter of a crime syndicate with the confidence and capability that's wonderful to see. James and Scodelario are brilliant when together on the screen.If you love Ritchie, you'll love this. It has everything you're used to out of a Ritchie story. It is also an indicator to Netflix what can happen when they give money to a talented man and let him run with it.","Top quality show and a note to Netflix, this is what happens when you give money and a platform to a talented moviemaker"

It was suprising, how good that was and now I feel pretty empty with the feeling that I don't know if anything in that specific genre gonna feel the same.Every character in that show was different in some way even if they have little time in the screen. I think the entire cast was amazing.The style of directing by Guy Ritchie is different and I love it, I wish it's not gonna be over and he have more suprises for us in the future.",Perfection of Action and Comedy

Great story.Superb acting.Fantastic directing.Awesome picture.Fabulous locations.You will pay attention to the reviews dismiss them if you care.You will obey the hype of your friends telling you it's amazing and you'll end up watching it.My only gripe....
There's only a few episodes and before you know it, it'll be done........... and you'll be left wanting more.Great work to all involved
Thank you Mr Guy Ritchie.Oh and Mr Vinnie Jones.. You've pulled a blinder Sir.Please, please, please, please, please make a season two.We'll all be happy to wait for the perfect second season.",Leaves you wanting more.... more.... more.
elinsketer,7,9 April 2024,"Following on from an absolurely incredible movie, this show reboots the premise that set the bar incredibly high. The show starts off really engaging with the team moving from crisis to crisis, but starts to fall apart after too many characters come into play and plotlines get tangled and cease making sense. The final episode is quite frustratingly dull and at this point you realise many of the characters' motivations have stopped making sense.Loose seams aside, this is still a great fun show for weeknight watching.As is customary for this sort of thing, the various criminals you meet along the journey are fantastic characters and being a lot of fun and life to the show.","Great fun, but does fall apart towards the end"
Icarus-707,10,23 March 2024,"This series is basically the definition of a Guy Ritchie movie done right. Literally every episode is a standalone story that has a proper introduction, climax and conclusion, and yet it still adds to the bigger picture in some way. The style, the writing, the comedy and even the characters are just top-notch. The writing is just phenomenal, there's just something about Guy Ritchie's screenplay which is effortlessly funny. Given how the first season wraps up, I think there's still a lot more to explore in this fictional crime world set up by Ritchie's 2019 film. Hope they renew it for another season!",Peak Guy Ritchie!
MoalefSajad,7,24 March 2024,"Netflix is generally looking for maximum sales rather than story appeal and creating something new!Most Netflix productions are mediocre at best, and most of them you forget about after watching because it's so monotonous. Only luxury and wealth. The Gentlemen is completely different and may actually be one of the best shows I've ever seen.It can be said that superior acting, superior directing, superior writing, basically above everything else. Guy Ritchie is in perfect form here.The Irish writer-director beautifully showcases witty dialogue and complex, yet funny characters and their twists and turns and a solid storyline.It is suggested to sit and watch in peace.",The Hardest Thing Is To Be A Gentleman !
barrymw,4,19 March 2024,"I've seen this a hundred times before and usually in a Guy Ritchie effort. They all follow the same template and the characters are identikit replicas of previous films. Stoner imbecile f...s up - check, gang of scousers - check, Vinnie Jones playing caricature of Vinnie Jones - check, east European gangsters - Check. The list goes on and by half way through episode three I felt as though I was trying to walk waist deep through treacle. There just isn't any tension or excitement when you know that with each scheme/job/task it's going to go wrong and that will lead to an escalation.It's okay to dip in and out of but it does t really hold your attention .

There are so many bad series nowadays, this one rices far above it. The humor is great to.The story of The Gentlemen is located in England. It is about the old aristocracy and the modern world and where they come together. It is filmed at great locations. The houses are awesome. The story is original and never gets boring or vulgar.

All characters fitted well. The dialogues and cinematography is best. The areas where the entire series is focused looks marvellous.Must watch if you love crime and underworld series. The Gentlemen is all about dark world of crime and how to stand in front of criminal crowd.Sometimes you feel it a bit slow because of personal life scenes of characters but when it comes to the duke and miss glass part the story again runs in fast speed and you feel enjoying.",Must Watch
ianharrison747,8,25 March 2024,"That was fun, right from the start. It will never win any Biftas or Baftas, but will liven up a dull and dark night.Bit of a jigsaw but all the pieces mesh together sometimes like barbed wire. Ray Winstone is the fox throughout and there are also two Foxes in the cast.Relative new people. Kaya Scodelario And Theo James ooze charisma and bristle with friction. Even Vinnie Jones is impressive ! No acting lessons needed. Echoes of Snatch especially with the interesting travellers, although Brad Pitt would have been a fabulous guest.There is a great joke - one mustn't spoil it. All to be said is D. H. Lawrence would shuffle in his grave. Hats off to Joely Richardson for playing a magnificent game. Magnificent romp and circumstance.",'I'm just a gamekeeper Charlotte '
iaregamertom,8,7 March 2024,"This is a review after episode 5.I have just binge watched 5 episodes in one evening. On the one hand, this is like a more mature Guy Ritchie production, and this is coming from a slightly biased Guy Ritchie fan since of course lock stock and onwards.I would recommend watching the film ""the gentlemen"" first as it does give context on a lot of things but is by no means needed, not seeing that will not matter to you enjoying and understanding the series.If you have watched that, then you will like this, but this is a slightly more ""fun"" take on that world.For those that havent, this is a look into the gangster world working with the struggling nobility world of minor dukedom and their bills and responsibilities in the modern world where the costs are hitting even them.There is an element of ""really???"" to a sub plot or two, but if you overlook this and embrace the sometimes ridiculousness of certain elements of the story, its really fun to watch, I love it, I gave it an 8 based purely on my own personal enjoyment which I think is fair, from a pragmatic reviewer perspective taking every aspect in, acting, cinematography, plot etc, possibly a 6-7 depending, but I stand by my 8.Lastly, I love the subplot involving Vinnie Jones and. Joely Richardson, it was nice to see Vinnie in a more mature role and honestly I would've watched their story alone in a separate program without giving spoilers.Definitely not your typical Guy Ritchie addition but I like the direction he is going in his career.",Very fun watch
altereggo123,10,15 March 2024,"Let's see... This series glorifies and sugar-coats the violent world of drug dealing. Its characters are outlandishly weird. The plots are improbable. Also,, there is never a dull moment. The dialogue has a light touch, and the sets, costumes and overall look are gorgeous. It's impressive and maybe a little annoying that the characters are so fashionably attired and their surroundings so elegant in almost every scene. The soundtrack was great too, sort of like if Purcell had rewritten his King Arthur opera while on drugs.Guy Ritchie has a gift for mixing rough criminal elements with toffs in stately British homes. Or, alternatively, for one of the characters, making a term in prison seem like life on a country estate. Plot-wise, one can see the outlines of the ending forming early on, but each episode still contained surprises, and each was a visual treat to boot.My only concern is that, if there is a season 2, it may be anticlimactic. This was an exciting romp, and it will be hard to sustain.","Morally bankrupt, probably bad for your brain, and wildly entertaining."
markhall-34879,6,10 March 2024,"I liked this I will say from the start, but in truth it is a 2 hour film dragged out over 8 episodes.Some of the characters were a no no, especially Theo the main character, I still see him as the annoying rep from the Inbetweeners movie, Susie,Jack and Freddie however were exceptional. This may just be me if you haven't seen
The Inbetweeners movie, but I don't think he played anything different apart from the coksure fool.The film sorry series is a typical Guy Ritchie adventure, with too many characters that would probably not of been missed if they were not even mentioned in this series.Gus from Breaking Bad is as always a top actor, and Vinnie Jones although mot a great actor, never disappoints in his role.If there was a second series would I watch it YES, but I would rather they did it as a film.",Yes and No

rwburkey-65775,7,3 April 2024,"The Gentlemen is filled with unique, interesting characters just as any of his previous films have shown. It is entertaining enough to continue through each episode, but there are many plot holes scattered throughout. This is the best Netflix Original show in a looooooooong time.The two main characters (Edward & Susie) have pretty good chemistry throughout the show and are a part of what makes the show interesting. Some characters are insufferable (Freddie & Jimmy).I really enjoyed the style of storytelling Ritchie choice for this show (a wink to Snatch & others) but some episodes lack realistic plots and lack logic.The sets used throughout the episodes are fantastic. The Manors used are beautiful, and there is a diverse set of places visited (did not see any green screens). The costume sets used are also spot on. Kudos to the costume director.Regardless, it is a show worth watching. As mentioned before, more entertaining than much of the garbage streaming services are pumping out.","If You Like Guy Ritchie's Previous Work, Worth Watching"
andrewharris-85229,2,9 March 2024,"The story is stupid. Nothing makes sense. Nobody in the story acts in a believable way. Netflix went overboard on their usual tack of taking moderately good premises and turning them in to garbage and they dragged poor Mr. Ritchie along with them.There's an old English estate that gets inherited and a stupid brother with a large debt. The plot drags us to crazy venue after crazy venue while trying to save the brother from himself.We have a drug kingpin who is meek and helpful like a schoolteacher. We have a weird groundskeeper who ends up as dull as a rock. It's just all wrong and it doesn't work at all.I love Snatch. I love Lock Stock. This muck is the high school drama club version of them. Don't expect anything like what was achieved with those movies, though this mess pretends to try.There are funny moments but that's as good as it gets.",Wow this sucks
adasgail88,9,18 March 2024,It's hilarious with chaotic charters and riotous action sequences. A refreshing and truly binge worthy series by Netflix. Guy Ritchie back with bang in this genuine dark comedy. Daft idiots thrown in English Aristocracy set up with multiple criminal gangs makes it thrilling and humors. It is a different take on aristocracy mixed with crime combined with witty dialogues. The one-liners and crazy charters play vital role in this laugh riot. Reminds some of the crime movies with maddening action sequences by lovable charters. Theo James portrayed his pivotal role smartly with all others making the series thoroughly enjoyable.,Top class dark comdey

The vintage props and vintage sets. Wow. It's got all you need for a night of popcorn romance infront of the old black box and it's punching knock-out blows after knock-out blows that leave ya wanting more. It's brutal; it's gangland; it's raw and damn it's gritty!The lead protagonist is the fantastic Theo James as the DUKE or Eddie Horniman. Now you get where the show is going with this kind of funny play-on name. The show starts with his Dad passing. His brother; played by Daniel Ings; assumes he's going to inherit the estate and its main assets. Infact it goes very wrong for him. The hero Eddie receives the estate and in some bombshell twists finds out what is really going on. Then his brother's secrets come out. Then it starts going mental. I loved the pace and the chemistry between the fantastic Kaya Scodelario who plays Susie Glass and our Duke.Then you have the great Vinnie Jones as the groundsman extraordinaire and Ray Winstone is Bobby Glass; Susie's illustrious criminal father and then you have great supporting acting from Michael Vu as Jimmy; Joely Richardson as Lady Sabrina; Chanel Cresswel as the brothers' sister; Tam Horniman and Logan Dean does a fabulous job as Blanket and Giancarlo Esposito as the tough guy negotiator Stanley Johnson.It's got a lot of twists and turns and it keeps you wanting more after each episode. The violence is real and often comical and played to great methods. It's a really fun show and you just have to watch out the extra cinematography techniques which Richie loves to use. The pace is stunning and 8 parts soon go by too fast. It's a fabulous show and I enjoyed it more than the movie. Richie you fine god-damn aging wine. You've done it again!,Richie Nails It Again

We gave it a try despite the lousy synopsis and hesitant first episode but swallowed season 1 in only 4 days. Theo James and Kaya Scodelario lead the story impeccably. Eddie and Susie have this successful tension and awkward synergy in an endless rollercoaster, and Daniel Ings successfully makes us hate and love Freddy as if it was real. Joely Richardson and compassionate character Lady Sabrina balance the story without disappointing. And Vinnie Jones as Geoff is one of my favorite characters. What a man.

You will find cleverly thought out characters, great actors, beautiful settings and a very good story. Fun, comedic, yet dark in a way that manages to not generate heavy or negative emotions from the viewer. I love a morally ambiguous character that I can root for.Considering it's Netflix putting it out, it might just be in that minority of shows that are actually so high quality that anyone, regardless of their usual preferences, can enjoy. I was a fan of the 2019 movie, and while that did not disappoint, the story in this series, is quite a bit more complex and developed, though it it easy to follow. Be on the lookout for a few easter eggs in tribute to another great series.If you want to relax and entertain yourself look no further.",Thoroughly enjoyable series.
jbvbddtp,9,14 March 2024,If you were a fan of the original movie of the same name then I think you'll like this too.Also from Guy Ritchie this mini series follows the story from the other side of the coin - the posh lot with big houses and *#¥* cash! When Edward's father dies following an accident he unexpectedly inherits the entire estate along with the title and an unexpected weed farm under the dairy! This is as much of the plot as I can say without spoiling the ride so just go with the flow!There is plenty of crossing and double crossing as the story unfolds and the tone is the same as the movie with plenty of laugh out loud moments as well as some naughty gangster violence.The script is superb and all the actors play their roles to perfection. I really hope we get a second series but I fear this may be one and done as GR has quite a lot on his plate at the moment.?,Bloody Brilliant!!!
Democrit,6,15 April 2024,"The plot element migrated from the film of the same name to the main part, the action is built around it: the director thought that the idea of a ""green laboratory"" in the family estate was interesting and provocative.Excellent production, good cinematography, intricate and vivid plot. The characters are interesting, it's nice to be nostalgic again with the charismatic Vinnie Jones and the director feels the same emotions, he keeps his ""favorite"" next to the main character, replacing the explosive male image with a retired composure - and it's a pity... Ray Winstone, an excellent dramatic actor, but on screens we often see him in the role of violent sociopaths and this series is not I became an exception for him.Theo James in the main role ... it seems to me that the main roles are not for him, no, get me right - he is charming, intelligent, but his game ... actors with a more expressive appearance can afford such a game. In general, it is absolutely not interesting to look at his acting, but in this movie image of a noble aristocrat, he is harmonious.Bright respectable hooliganism is able to entertain with humor, sharpness, stylish light presentation of material - the author's style is present. Of course, we have seen all this in previous films, but the director has irrevocably outgrown the most sincere author who lived on unemployment benefits, and with him rock'n'roll enthusiasm has gone.In the scene of the first episode, where the hero is present at an illegal fight and persuades his brother to take the ""bet"" - nothing happens: the hero repeatedly demands from his brother to abandon the bet, and that's it. At that moment, I was convincing myself: now Guy Ritchie is sure to surprise with a sparkling twist, now ... but no, the hero will get angrily drunk and chew his cheekbones importantly. Of course, the scene is not meaningless, yes, there is a necessary twist of the ""lying bookmaker"", but...I couldn't watch the first episode before the final and the whole series as a whole.",The author's rhythm will find its audience

SonGoku540,7,16 April 2024,"Guy Ritchie returns to the world he carved out with the 2019 film ""The Gentlemen,"" this time as a limited series on Netflix. While not a direct sequel, the show captures the same frenetic energy and dark humor that fans loved.The series throws you into a whirlwind of double-crosses, shady deals, and high-stakes criminal activity. Each episode keeps you guessing with its twists and turns. Ritchie's signature dialogue is on full display. The characters trade barbs with a dry British wit that's both funny and insightful. Theo James delivers a charming performance as the befuddled aristocrat Freddy, while Giancarlo Esposito brings a menacing presence as the ruthless businessman Stanley Johnston. The scene-stealer, however, is Kaya Scodelario as the ice-cold yet fiercely intelligent Susie. The show boasts a slick visual style with Ritchie's signature quick cuts and dynamic camerawork. The soundtrack is equally impressive, combining classic rock with contemporary tunes that set the mood perfectly.While the initial episodes are exhilarating, the plot can get repetitive in the later half. The cycle of ""problem arises, solution emerges, bigger problem appears"" starts to feel predictable. Despite the strong performances, the show prioritizes plot twists over character depth. You won't find much emotional resonance with most characters.The production value is top-notch. The cinematography is stylish, the editing keeps the pace brisk, and the score adds to the overall atmosphere.The Gentlemen is a fun and stylish romp through the British criminal underworld.

There is no character development, history, sex, romance, flashbacks of his life, something that would bring more personality to the duke.

youngman44,10,16 March 2024,"This series was just a breath of fresh air. TV series' movies, it's all about entertainment. And this show does just that. Far better than most top tier programs, it was the classic Guy Ritchie events of posh and gritty, upper class and raw evil, blood, murder, and entertaining humor. It brought several twists and continual hurdles for the protagonists to overcome. Yet, even the protagonists have their moments where one wonders - who is the good guy/girl and who is the bad guy/girl in this situation?Theo James was excellent as the central family figure and lead, playing his role as an upper class yet with an experienced toughness. And fearlessness.The ever attractive Kaya Scodelario plays her role to the hilt. Tough, fearless, and seemingly untouchable - she is superb.In fact all the acting is exceptional and the actors are perfectly cast to their roles, from Ray Winstone to Joey Richardson, alongside the ever stable Vinnie Jones and the eminently unstable Daniel Ings.The dialogue and plot twists kept the show going such that I could have binged watched it had my wife allowed!Overall, I would give it a 9.5. So, 10. Guy Ritchie has given us a fine and entertaining work. Well written. Solid plot lines. Phenomenal script. And the acting and casting is spot on.This came along when I really needed to escape into another world and it's been perfect.Thank you Guy Ritchie.","Refreshing, Fun, & Classically Guy Ritchie"

Yes, the movie was great, no argument there, but a series, if well done, allows you to further explore the plot, situation and related characters. The script is briliant, the actors, although mostly unknown, they do a terrific job, the production tip top, and we do even have pikeys, i am missing the russians, we hope to find them in the plot within the next episodes.

He always writes cool and/or rememberable characters within a story that takes it twists and turns and just keeps you wanting more, and finally, with this series, you will get it! No nudity, no forced action, no cliche lines, instead he made Pigeons that carry out messages look badass, what a genius!Even though its a crime/gangster drama, there is no police side of the story, you dont have detectives that nobody cares about dragging on the show, its just the cool guys on screen all the time, and the acting of all involved actors/actresses are phenomenal.I binged through the whole show in 2 days, the last time this happened to me was when 1883 came out, I think that speaks volumes to its quality.It is said that when Godfather came out, Italian Mobsters would start to imitate the characters from the movie just because of how impressive they were, I think modern criminals should do the same with Guy Richies characters.

72/8=Solid 9As my headline states phenomenal. In the US and globally this show should be in the #10 spot in the US for 4-5 months. In my humble opinion this is the first time Netflix topped Lilyhammer since they engaged in original programming. The movie neck and neck with Snatch, with an expanded detailed scope. Outside Kill Bill Volumes, this could have been 3 volumes of great cinema.Perfect blend of the bizarre, great twists, and phenomenal dark comedy. Like most times phenomenal dialogue in a Tarantino UK sense.Like Scorcesse this is Guy Ritchie's Genre stick with a British cast and criminality.I haven't been nabbed by a series with enthusiasm like this since the first three seasons of ""The Sopranos"".From the moment they sat down to read the will, I loved the comedy, dialogue (albeit somewhat derivative from his films). The concept of creating a story from the point of view of the Heir Duke was a brilliant turn around from the film (where the estates were presented as more passive and content with the cash flow).Opening the show with the captain at checkpoints in Syria also gave insight into the ""Duke"" and as a soldier to quote Tony Soprano ""we're soldiers, a code, so I'm not going to hell"".The 'Functional' dysfunctional sibling relationship parallels were also brilliantly orchestrated. With Sussie & Bobby as well as Freddy & Edward.The enemies of Dixon, Mercy, Maxi, & Degrote were utterly hysterical as was ""Chucky"".I'm not doing spoilers but there are no weak scenes or episodes and it ends where if it's not renewed you'll be satisfied.

Theo James does a fine job as the lead. Daniel Ings, as his brother, is a bit over-the-top, but he's supposed to be. I'm not as sold on Kaya Scodelario. Joley Richards is excellent as the dark-horse mother. Vinnie Jones is along for the ride in a different type of role for him. Giancarlo Esposito is playing on familiar ground as a low-key, successful meth dealer. And, it's always good to see Ray Winstone.The writing is not as tight as the movie. All-in-all this is a shiny cubic zirconia, but not a diamond. But, I look forward to Season 2.","A Worthy Copy, But Not The Original"
penetad,10,27 March 2024,Stunning ! V v enjoyable . I really love this show. This was my first expierience with Guy Richie as a director and it was an awesome expierience. And Theo did a great job playing eddie. The right amount of humour and 'drama'. Keeps you engaged and characters are quickly fleshed out and likeable. Makes you want to binge watch all episodes. Loved the GR ending . Reading the reviews from boring people trying to sound intellectual is laughable . Great cast and it moved at just the right pace for it . In my personal opinion this is one of the greatest TV-shows that Guy Ritchie have created. Sublime cast and great narrative for the story. I will deffinetlie tune back in if they make a season 2.,Just wow . Incredible
Siminalu,6,8 March 2024,"Even the first episode alone is 100x better than the the film.Was a big fan of Guy Richy films, but the film version was the worst pile of dog sh I've seen for a long time. It was covered in bad acting, accents and amateure cringe having clowns like bugsy malone, and overall just a terrible film with an American guy as the main Gentleman.Nearly walked out of the cinema.Anyhow, Series is good.Acting is good, storyline and characters are much better.Not sure about them using gus fring from braking bad as a meth king pin once again in another series, bit silly.Also, I wasn't looking forward to seeing vinny Jones in it being a terrible actor and that. But to be fair can't fault the guy in this. More of a subtle roles is much better suited to him.The background music is a bit repetitive.Ending of the first series is why I rated it a 6.1) They never discussed who got the money from when susie lied and put the scouse lad on the boat to be killed with q bag of cash. Who ended up with that, because Eddie didn't ask for it back?2) if the American billionaire meth King pin was so big time, then I doubt the money cleaning guy would have supplied them with his tax information as he'd end up a dead man having more money and power than the glass family, even with assets frozen. He was also sat with Mr glass at the end in their luxurious prison.3) didn't say what they did to make things right with the scouse vicar. They killed his brother yet he didn't want justice and just did a deal with Mr glass instead? Not having it.Besides that, very watchable and good series.",Better Than The Film (thank god)
james-753-809157,3,11 March 2024,"Lame.Guy Richie is very hit or miss.This is a miss.Starts well and then looses all imagination.Very plastic characters and same old cast doing the same old parts with less enthusiasm each time they are rolled out. It sounds like they are reading of cards most of the time.I still watched it and it was better than a lot of Netflix shows but the fact that it gets 8.4 on here seems rediculous... Hence having to write this review...
So if you are a fan of guy Richie style films I would rewatch Lock, stock and two smoking barrels or even The film The Gentlemen and save yourself a few hours of your life...",8.4 stats? 4.8 is generous
nataliflach,9,17 March 2024,"Easy to follow, great plot and a story that moves forward in the perfect way. The characters have a clear line, they are almost cartoon like villains. In a good way. Guy Richie has a specific talent to create characters and ""Gentlemen "" is a perfect example of that.Acting is on point and the scirpt is unusually smart and well written. There are no boring parts and I was hooked after 10 minutes. There is no way of telling what will come next.In other shows I will get annoyed when somethings are not believable or don't make sense in the ""real world"" but I don't mind it at all in this show. Watch it !",Watch this !
jessef-49153,9,2 April 2024,"I always felt Guy Ritchie missed the mark on most of his movies. His two truly great films being Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch, in my opinion. The others, though somewhat entertaining, never really captured what those two did. Until now.Witty, snappy dialogue, engaging performances, the semblance of sophistication marked with short bursts of brutal violence, all saturated with a heavy dose of black comedy, are here in full force. And warehouses full of marijuana - lest we forget. All the markings of a classic Guy Ritchie tale.Handing the helm to other directors to take on different episodes didn't detract from this unique UK gangster saga. I was genuinely engaged throughout the entire series. So why, after a long and successful movie career, does it seem like Ritchie has created a work a notch above the rest? That's a hard question to answer - story, performances, and pacing? Possibly. I think it has more to do with trial and error and Ritchie finding his stride, yet again, and a masterful return to form.",Guy Ritchie Returns to Form
dahag,9,18 March 2024,"Although I was skeptical at first, I enjoyed it.So, sit back with your preferred beverage of choice, relax, and be entertained by some cheeky good fun.Smart dialogue from the aristocratic implied verbage to common street lingo of thugs. In my opinion, this seemed like a mixture of Ozark and Peaky Blinders, though milder, with a few twists and turns. An enjoyable way to spend a rainy day; the length of the series with eight episodes was just right.While everything for our protagonists seemed to be unraveling, in the end all loose ends were tied up in a neat bow, so to speak.Well cast with great acting by all.Will not disappoint.",Great fun.
garethwooduk,10,19 March 2024,"Hats off to Guy Richie, not lot of stuff is worthy of a watch on Netflix, but if you like the movie of the same name you'll love this!Not sure where to begin, plot wise it's forever changing as the plot just thickens at every turn & corner, but easily to follow.But its all the characters that are just a pure joy to watch, I like the slightly more relaxed role of the loyal maintenance man 'Geoffrey' played by a loyal Richie cast member 'Vinnie Jones' living on the premise attending to injured animals and the upkeep of the manor.Our leading stars Edward & Freddie as the lords of the manor are comicial gold along with the Glass family, no spoilers!This series is stylish, love the backdrops and the stately homes and furnishing, everything from the travellers to the Scousers are all pivital in the story tropes.Brilliantly shot in glorious 4K, hoping for a season 2!",Absolutely Brilliant!
pappywatts,9,10 March 2024,"I would say that the movie was essentially big stars and standalone, full of Guy Ritchie flavor.This series introducing home grown next generation refreshing, Theo James and Kaye Scodelario, Vinnie Jones were solid, Ray Winstone,a master of dialogue and great delivery.And at the beginning.. a very short cameo from Edward Fox which sets the start, The Duke Of Halstead...playing the dying Toff.Which is totally fictitious, I was born in Colchester,where halstead is on the north west edge and you can almost find a decent pub lunch.No Lords there...Daniel Ings a revelation....really drives the tension, a master of disaster and ineptitude.Way better than the Layer Cake, this had more ingredients.I'll quote something I learnt from employment within local government, and the civil service, happily retired decades ago...
"" Why are lawyers buried 8' 0"" feet below, instead of the regulation 6' 0""
Because deeper down, they're really nice people.....I binge watched the first 7 episodes, and last episode following day,
which was really resolution and last minute reveals, and scores settled.Has all the elements and quirky characters introduced, all heading towards disaster, but as the episodes unfolded,you find out who's
working for whom, and jockying for position.Miss Scodelario was an absolute delight, almost completely unrecogisable from her previous blockbuster characters.Totally solid direction , manic script.This really was a Cockney,Gypsy,Multi- cultured, gangster movie,
mixing in the Upper Classes, and the pecking order below.The Hidden establishment within the UK, business first, a great portrayal of criminal politics, and the British class system.","Sucked In, Riveting, Its Just Business and very Personal"
cmconnexion,9,15 March 2024,"It took Guy Ritchie (""with a T"") nearly thirty years to secure Ray Winston in one of his movies. It was worth the wait. Winston, along with an ensemble cast of actors from the British stable, along with Giancarlo Esposito from across the pond give electric performances in this riveting eight-part series inspired from Guy Ritchie's own ""The Gentlemen"".Veteran Actors, Ray Winston, Giancarlo Esposito, Joely Richardson, Pearce Quigley, and Guy Ritchie's ""go-to tough guy"" Vinnie Jones compliment a slew of fresh faces on the international streaming circuit.Diving into detail of the mechanics of weed production and distribution in true Guy Ritchie fashion, this series not only postponed my impending cancellation of Netflix, it had me riveted to my seat when it finally arrived. Brilliantly written, twists, turns, sophisticated yet snappy dialogue, and exquisite suits one could only expect from Guy Ritchie.The standout performance would have to be from Theo James, playing the main character of Eddie; the unexpected heir to his Lord father's estate, and who unexpectedly inherits the burden of weed producers operating on his land. Theo gives Eddie a steely but likable character, who has more than his fair share of disconcert with this unwanted business, a drug-up lunatic brother, and deeper trouble with every turn, yet he has iron will to do what he must o preserve his family's legacy. If warm velvet chocolate could speak, it would be the smooth sound of Theo James.I will be watching it again, for the third time. The more you watch, the more you notice the smaller details. A wonderful ensemble, phenomenal story and a great way for anyone to spend eight hours.","BRILLIANT! ""It was emotional."" Thank you Guy Ritchie!"
DLochner,7,23 March 2024,"At 16, I would have probably found the series very good - lots of exaggerated coolness and silly kids' jokes. So, classic Guy Ritchie entertainment - not too serious, not too deep, sometimes overly constructed and over the top. Those who enjoy that will find a balanced mix of action and humor in the series. Everything is stylishly executed with creative camerawork. Just like in ""Snatch"" or ""The Gentlemen,"" on which the series is based, he once again embraces the gangster genre. His formula of having the protagonists stumble from one problem to the next is initially amusing but eventually tiresome, although it remains somewhat entertaining.The series is actually worth watching, but I don't think you're missing out on much if you don't see it.",As a teenie I would have probably found the series very good

Then, Freddy messed everything up.Freddy is infuriating. Everything would be smooth had it not for his actions.So the show's premise is about dealing with the Mafia and other groups' involvement with drugs.The story is tired- comparable to shows like, Nails, Good Girls, and etc. Except for the ""royal"" affectation. Unless there are stories or news about the royals being involved in cartels, the show is like a tough pill to swallow.It would be more relatable if it includes a narrative about human trafficking.",DRUGS?

Similar story, similar development, similar elements, similar jokes and humor but much more watery this time around.It is like Guy is stuck with double Barrels, drug lords, pykeies, weed farmers, shooting people in the face, bookies, opportunistic folks, easy money and fixing boxing matches.I was thrilled to see a new title from Guy Ritchie on Netflix and I jumped right at it, but halfway it felt like I already seen it. Many of the situations are repetitions from previous movies and plots and sequence are very similar to what you have seen in Snatch, RockanRolla, Lock, Stock and Revolver except that it was well cooked in those movies and here it is taken out of the oven too early.Just like fake brand shoe, details are watered up and has poor finish and the sequence of events lack logic at times and outcomes are as predictable as it could be with many gaffes to be discovered by the viewer.This is the least rating I ever given to a Guy Ritchie movie/series.",I am disappointed!

Kudos to all involved, the smartest thing I've seen in a decade.Fantastic cast, other than Ray Winstone and Vinnie Jones, I was fairly unfamiliar with all of them; nonetheless they were sensational.

rfanhu,9,26 March 2024,"Much like the original 2019 movie, this show is a fun and entertaining ride, with a posh setting and fancy visuals.If you liked the movie, you'll probably like this show.If you like Guy Ritchie's other works, you'll probably like this show.The story is solid and has some great twists and turns - lots of moments that reminded me of ""Breaking Bad-style"" storytelling.In classic Guy Ritchie fashion, it never feels *too* serious, and there are many eccentric, unique characters.Why not a 10/10? Just two reasons:2. The first episode had a very slow start.I almost dropped the show because, 30 minutes in, so little had happened. But, the ending sequence of the first episode convinced me to stick around for the second episode, and by the end of the second episode I was hooked.3. The last episode sucked.The middle of the series was a great ride, but sadly it came to a screeching halt in the season finale. Without spoilers: the last episode was full of exposition. Very little actual action, lots of talking, and boring, predictable outcomes. The few cool things that happened were cut down into 5 second flashbacks. It may have been necessary to tie up loose ends and set the series up for a season 2, but it was supremely disappointing. I think the series could've used an extra 2 episodes -- instead, we were robbed of a satisfying resolution to lots of very interesting storylines.I read some news saying a second season is likely, and this may eventually grow into a ""Guy Ritchie multiverse"" franchise. I sure hope it happens!","If you liked the movie, you'll like this!"
robmorris-46813,6,22 March 2024,"Expectations for this were high as I; enjoyed the film, have generally enjoyed most of Guy Ritchie's stuff and the casting looked spot on. Then I started watching it.The 1st episode is solid enough, it does a good job of introducing the characters, and unlike a lot of shows keeps the interest alive to watch the next episode, and if I'm honest probably all the episodes after that.I noticed myself picking up on and becoming bored of some of the same old Guy Ritchie tropes, like the henchman who we are supposed to believe is a bit dim and takes everything literally but has a photographic memory of the meaning of every word in the dictionary.The series itself is like watching someone playing Grand Theft Auto on the playstation; a series of tasks which the protagonist has to complete in order to move onto the next episode and the scribbled writing started to do my head in a bit aswell.Throughout the whole series my favourite, but all too short bit, (no spoilers) was the corndog sequence, it's the first time I've seen this actor ( you'll know who I'm talking about when you see him) but he's the standout for me, a very funny guy and probably worth 2 out of the 6 stars I gave in this review.",Corndog anyone?

Only gambling ,fights , sports and it was kind of surprising and disappointing at the same time .

ger55champ,2,21 March 2024,Seen some utter rubbish from Netflix but this is up there with the worst of all.I'm convinced Guy Ritchie is now obsessed with gangsters and has zero talent to make anything remotely different or memorable.The first 2 episodes has you curious but you quickly realise you've seen all the same rubbish before with this mad director.The acting isn't the most wooden but the storyline is farcical with absolutely nothing believable or even amusing.All the glorifying of violence is sad and pathetic.And genuinely not helpful with all the gang culture we are having in this Country at this moment.It's sick and very lame to be honest.You will be bored senseless by the 4th episode.,Utter dross

It has an a-list of actors who perform their roles well. I liked the plot twists in the final episode. Hope there's a season 2.There was only one small thing I didn't like because it wasn't realistic. The main grower/engineer for a major marijuana operation is to make a delivery of product. That would never happen. Such a talk while be given to a more low level person. Then, when he loses a shipment worth 1.5 million, nothing bad happens to him.

Tomaslillebror,7,15 April 2024,"Guy Ritchie certainly have a certain recepie for his productions, it seems hes taken the style of detective movies like Monsieur Poirot and put a posh class theme on it.

With that said the story is this series weakest point, its illogical, low brow thuggery and mostly really dumb. Its just glitter and shadows, glitter and shadows... and he always seem to have a diversity goal and a finity for bashing nazis.In this series you will have every race represented but all are portraited as english.The imagery and the acting is the strong point and there are lots of well known actors in this piece.Camera and scenography is great, the actors are all well dressed and well mannered, except perhaps the ""travellers"".If you enjoy a lot of killing and all kinds low life criminalities then this might be for you.7/10 and thats me being generous.","Glitter and shadows, glitter and shadows.."
oshanbenjamin,10,12 March 2024,"Forget boring crime dramas, ""The Gentlemen"" is a breath of fresh air. It's got gangsters, action, and Ritchie's classic quirky characters, but it also packs a surprising punch. Theo James is hilarious as Eddie, an unsuspecting aristocrat who inherits a family estate, only to discover it's a marijuana empire. Eddie wants nothing to do with the illegal business, but the show takes him on a journey of self-discovery. He starts to question everything he thought he knew about himself and what he truly values. It's a wild ride with fast-paced action and witty dialogue, but underneath it all, it's a story about finding your own path, no matter the circumstances.",Self discover
Ito-Keiii,7,10 March 2024,"""The Gentlemen"" is a film that aims to marry the worlds of British nobility with the grim realities of the drug trade, yet it navigates this ambitious intersection with questionable ethics and a narrative that often glamorizes the very elements it seeks to critique. While Ritchie's signature style-quick wit, snappy dialogue, and complex plotting-is evident, the film's attempt to present its criminal protagonists in a positive light while justifying their actions through their noble ties results in a morally ambiguous, if not problematic, storytelling approach.At the core of ""The Gentlemen"" is the cannabis empire built by the protagonist, Mickey Pearson, portrayed with charismatic aplomb by Matthew McConaughey. Pearson's operation is depicted as not only immensely profitable but also seemingly risk-free, a narrative choice that dangerously simplifies the real-world dangers and ethical dilemmas of drug trafficking. The film indulges in a fantasy where the drug trade can be a gentleman's game, devoid of the consequences that plague less noble participants in such illegal endeavors.The portrayal of violence and justice in ""The Gentlemen"" similarly raises concerns. The characters, deeply entrenched in their criminal lifestyles, show no hesitation in eliminating their enemies, a depiction that aligns with the merciless nature of real-life organized crime yet is handled with a disturbing nonchalance in the film. This cavalier attitude towards violence and retribution is made more troubling by the film's failure to critically address the moral implications of the characters' actions, presenting a skewed version of justice that serves only the protagonists' interests.One of the film's central relationships, that between Mickey and his right-hand man, Ray (expertly played by Charlie Hunnam), attempts to add depth to the narrative, exploring themes of loyalty and protection within the criminal underworld. However, the execution of this dynamic, particularly in the context of the film's broader ethical oversights, feels superficial. The humorous portrayal of certain characters and situations, notably those involving Mickey's underlings, often undermines the seriousness of their criminal activities, making the film's tone uneven and its critique of organized crime lackluster.Furthermore, ""The Gentlemen"" concludes on a note that leaves much to be desired from an ethical standpoint. The film's resolution, which sees Mickey attempting to outmaneuver various threats to his empire, ends with a reaffirmation of the status quo rather than a reflection on the journey's moral cost. This ending, while perhaps consistent with the film's overall glorification of its criminal protagonists, misses an opportunity to engage with the deeper, more complex issues at play.In summary, ""The Gentlemen"" is a film that dazzles with its style, wit, and star-studded cast, yet falters in its ethical considerations and portrayal of the drug trade. By romanticizing its noble criminals and overlooking the real-world consequences of their actions, the film presents a narrative that is not only detached from reality but also morally questionable. While it offers entertainment value in spades, it ultimately serves as a reminder of the challenges and responsibilities filmmakers face when depicting organized crime and its participants.",Too simple

Actually, it was suppose to be all of those; turns out, it was none of them.It started with some very poor episodes, peaked with two brilliant episodes (thus garnering a solid 5 stars), and finished with some terrible ones.The majority of the episodes just meandered aimlessly around a very loose central theme that didn't really go anywhere.

The season finale was so bad, it had me cringing in my chair.One final point: I believe the character of Freddy existed only to demonstrate how stupid Eddie was. Why else would he continue to trust Freddy to do ANYTHING, if he wasn't stupid?",Huh?
ayonijaprithuvainya,9,17 March 2024,"If, like me, you are fan of Guy Ritchie (or Quentin Tarantino for that matter), you will love this. It is his trademark dark comedy mixed with crime drama, which fits in perfectly with core premise of British nobility mingling with organized crime. The show thrives on this theme of contrasting ingredients that create an entertaining blend.Much like the show's the two leads - one the head of a dukedom (i.e the Duke), another the de-facto head of a crime family. They have superb chemistry, which is like the engine that drives this show. Kaya Scoledario is perfection as the Cockney Comtesse of Crime. Vinnie Jones is shockingly good in a role very different from what he is used to. Michael Vu has a memorable break-through. Giancarlo Esposito is Giancarlo Esposito.The story itself continues that theme of contrast, mixing absurdity with actuality, humor with harsh reality. The downside is that sometimes characters do crazy things which make no sense. But the end-product is always funny and entertaining.A note for the fans of the original film - this show takes one of the sub-plots of the film and expands on it. However all the characters involved, despite some of them sharing the DNA as the originals, are different ones.",An 8 Hours Long Guy Ritchie Movie
Lucy1578,9,15 March 2024,"Really enjoyed it. Well written, stylish, crazy, funny. Theo James, Kaya Scodelario and Daniel Ings are on top form! Ings is freaking hilarious and I especially enjoyed his interactions with his on-screen brother, Eddie, played by Theo James (who just gets better and better with every new role). Theo and Kaya have just the right amount of sexual tension that makes you want to keep watching, but for once Guy Ritchie has a strong, independent woman (more of that, please!)
I also loved the dynamic with Joely Richardson as the lady of the manor and her soft/tough gamekeeper, Vinnie Jones. Clever nod to her memorable role as Lady Chatterley there!I have to take a star off for some of the stereotyping though, particularly the travellers. Although it was fun to see them rock up in their caravans at the Duke's estate and made me think this could be a good long-term solution to the lack of traveller sites! After all, why exactly do these aristocratic families own so much land? What right do they have?It was also quite obvious that Ritchie was only involved in the first 2 episodes. It wasn't as funny as the film of the same name, and the comedy died away halfway through and the focus was on the plot. But the characterisation was great and I had a lot of empathy for Eddie and Susie (could have done with less of Ray Winstone's unintelligible rasping perhaps).Overall, a cracking watch.",A cracking watch
Tactrix,10,12 March 2024,"This was done in Guy Ritchie's favorite style and writing. Everything is crisp, clean and you don't see most of it coming. He's of course included his favorites, royals, gypsies, meth dealers, weed dealers, butchers, and assassins. And that's just the start, he can easily turn this into a giant series that spawns for decades if he wanted to. Whatever you do, don't let Guy Ritchie take a backseat on the writing. His influence can be felt in every single scene in the movie. Don't you dare change this formula, it's brilliant and it shows.The cast is perfectly hand picked, I couldn't have picked them better myself. Everything just works, and when a good series comes together like this it's high art. You rarely see it, but when you do, you get another game of thrones on your hands.10/10 spectacular, don't you dare cancel this series!",The Proper Criminal
Fs90781,10,11 March 2024,"The main cast was so great, The casting is top tier. Theo James was born for this type of role in my opinion, but loved the plot, directing and all the rest was very entertaining and thrilling action with a classic Ritchie dark comedy. I truly enjoyed this series, it's been a long time since I really enjoyed a Gangster type of Series, since Breaking bad really. If you enjoyed Ritche movies and likes his style, you will most likely enjoy this show. A part of me want a season 2, but the other is afraid of being too repetitive, so let's see how it goes. But overall, a brilliant show. For sure I recommend.",One of the surprise of the year?
PedroReviews,8,18 March 2024,"Prepare for a thrilling adventure with ""The Gentlemen,"" a new Netflix series from Guy Ritchie. This action-packed comedy throws you headfirst into the gritty glamour of London's criminal scene. A sharp script, captivating story, and stellar cast make it a must-watch for fans of the genre.A Compelling Ensemble Steals the ShowTheo James leads the narrative as the enigmatic protagonist, but the supporting characters truly shine. We encounter a wisecracking right-hand man harboring a secret agenda, a ruthless kingpin with an unexpected moral compass, and an ambitious outsider caught in the crossfire. Their interactions crackle with energy, fueled by witty banter and tense power struggles. Even minor characters feel well-developed, adding layers of intrigue to the fast-paced plot.A Feast for the SensesGuy Ritchie's signature style is on full display. Crisp and stylish cinematography utilizes dynamic camera movements to heighten the action sequences. A particularly memorable scene uses a slow-motion tracking shot to showcase a meticulously planned heist, placing you right in the heart of the action. The cool blues and steely grays of the color grading perfectly complement the London underworld setting, creating a visually stunning atmosphere.Where Humor Meets GritThe plot races at breakneck speed, packed with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. While the action sequences are thrilling, it's the humor that elevates the show. Ritchie's signature wit shines through the sharp dialogue and hilarious situations. Imagine a tense negotiation interrupted by a deadpan quip - that's the kind of humor you can expect.A Recommendation with a Note""The Gentlemen"" isn't for everyone. The show features violence and adult humor, so keep that in mind if you have sensitivities. Additionally, the plot can be complex at times, requiring viewers to pay close attention.However, if you're looking for a stylish action-comedy with a healthy dose of British wit, then this is a definite winner. The show delivers strong performances across the board, with a captivating story, memorable characters, and a visually stunning presentation.

yogaisthepath,9,14 April 2024,"Almost perfect! You know its a classic when you start it from the beginning the moment you finish.Could watch 100 episodes of this.The story, script, acting, score, cinematography...it hits all the spots. Thank god Netflix and Guy made this happen.Make sure you out your phone away and enjoy it in full. There are lots of details and subtle moments that complete the viewing experience.Also, don't watch it on your phone. Do your best to have a tv with good sound system.The score is actually incredible. Brings the perfect amount of tension and pace to everything that happens.Crazy how the lead actor isn't the next James Bond.Maybe its because there are more seasons of this too come???",Instant classic.
trumpisafatpileofshit,7,8 April 2024,"The one thing that keeps irking me is that the skip over the best parts. Every scene of action and killing is told as a chopped up flash back. Yeah I get it, Guy Ritchie is a formulaic one trick pony. But I like his past work, but this is different because it's every single episode. You only get a quick half second of the action while some one else is telling the story of what happened. A battle with nazis and explosions... passed over quick. Three people on a hit list after a fixed fight... 1,2,3, done.I don't watch a show to see the filler, I want the meat. Unfortunately, the meat in this is shaved down to scrapes, and all your left with is a lot of lettuce. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great taco, delicious in fact, but no where near enough meat.Worth the watch, but I'm just saying. If it happened in only a few episodes I wouldn't have cared so much, but it's every episode, every action scene.",I really really liked this but...
jewellz48,9,12 April 2024,"I thought this was fantastic as a highly entertaining, stylish romp! Sometimes, it's fun to just be entertained, and The Gentlemen scratches that itch supremely well. The acting and pacing are snappy and snazzy without being maniacal, and the setting and music complemented the tone well.Theo James really nailed his role as a newly minted Duke with a heart of stone, and the rest of the cast effortlessly held their own. The chemistry between Eddie and Susie was palpable, and I really hope this gets renewed for more.Highly recommend this as an escapist treat that can easily be watched in a weekend!",Stylish romp
dierregi,6,9 May 2024,"If you're familiar with Guy Ritchie's movies you know what you're getting yourself into. His stories are about eccentric British gangsters who use convolute language, violence and a lot of swearing. That sums up most of this series, inclusive of cool characters, fast editing, atrocious soundtrack and occasional visual tricks.The saving grace are the interpreters of main characters Eddie (the Duke) and Susie (the Boss' daughter), who have believable chemistry, luckily without any sentimental strings attached. Ray Winstone as the Bobby the Boss is also good, albeit playing it too cool.The Duke's family lives in a beautiful estate - slightly too grand and with way too much staff - and Eddie's mum is straight out of Lady Chatterley's lover, inclusive of liaison with gamekeeper Geoff and illegitimate offspring, even if both mum and daughter totally irrelevant to the plot, but someone must have told Ritchie a feminist touch was needed, so the daughter is single, pregnant and proudly parading her belly. What's got to do with the plot? Whatever...Eddie's brother is the idiotic Freddy, I guess a parody of the useless, addict, degenerate aristocrat, but a very annoying character. On the criminal side, the annoying counterpart is Jimmy, a silly pothead who in real life would be terminated ASAP, but in the show he is the ""comic relief"" (Hint: he's not funny, just annoying as hell). However, the rest of criminals all seem more or less caricatures, starting from the demented Scouses to the suave but tax-evading Johnston, the spillover from Breaking Bad. The show includes the inevitable boxing scenes, gambling, car chases (green Lamborghini, nonetheless!) and Eastern European gangs. However, the criminal world seems to be more fun than aristocratic parties.One glaring mistake: the Belgian character is a Flemish named de Groot but he speaks French! Ritchie's team should research better, since Belgians are very sensitive to this type of things and even I not being Belgian but having lived there several years, noticed the incongruity of a Flemish character who speaks French. That would NEVER happen.On the whole it's entertaining enough even if very predictable with each episode creating a previously unforeseen problem to be solved and the introduction of a truckload of characters.",Entertaining but not stellar
wackyfuncrazy,3,1 April 2024,"I recently watched the first four episodes before deciding I couldn't watch any more. Here are my reasons why:Theo James. I didn't find him believable as a duke and not just because of his awful accent that reminded me of Dr Lucien Sanchez from Garth Marenghi's Darkplace played by Matt Berry. He seems to have no screen presence and I wasn't convinced that he cared about any of the crazy situations in which he found himself. Also, how did he get out of the army so quickly?Kaya Scodelario was just too obvious and cliche as the tough as nails 'woman in charge'. I would've preferred her to be a little more vulnerable: I wondered why she needed anyone working for her since she seemed to be able to do and handle anything.I felt Vinnie Jones was just put in this to make it seem like an 'authentic' Guy Ritchie production. He was completely wasted and they could've done so much more with him.I barely knew Joely Richardson was in this which is enough said about her really.I could already see that the woman who tricked Michael Vu's character would end up liking him. There is no way that is even remotely credible. Speaking of Michael Vu, he was in this for too much and his character was extremely irritating.Ray Winstone. Again, it seemed he was just in this to make it seem more authentic. Useless character and another waste.Giancarlo Esposito. Only in this to make fans of Breaking Bad go 'ohh it's Gus! I bet he's really vicious underneath!' I was hoping he would be a cameo but no, he kept coming back. He's pretty much just another Gus to give cheap appeal to a wider audience.This is one of those series where the main plot will never get wrapped up, they'll make it up as they go along and then they'll cancel it before the ratings topple. We've seen all this before: the mixing of brutal gang violence with humour, the 'witty' dialogue, the ridiculous crimes and the over the top characters which would never exist in the real world. It should be getting long in the tooth for everyone now really.",Haven't we seen all this before?
alanspamaccount,9,2 April 2024,"This s a great and original series from Guy Ritchie. I see some people have given pretty negative ratings which I guess is given to their propensity for men in capes and women with bat ears. It's clever and bears the hallmark of traditional British black humour with stellar performances, especially shining the light on the absurdity of the British class system. It's gritty but humourous with a great cast and solid writing. Highly recommend giving it a go.I binged the entire show in tow (workday) evenings and hope Netflix will commission another....but also, somethings are also better left with something hanging in the air.....Great TV and worth your time viewing.",Really good and bingeworthy
sue-06239,8,25 March 2024,"This series, based on the film of the same name, is entertaining and typical Guy Ritchie fare - full of quirky characters, sparky, articulate dialogue and violence.Theo James is fantastic in this and plays as if auditioning for the James Bond role - which based on this he'd be perfect for. I absolutely love his voice in this role! Ably supported by Kaya in a wardrobe to die for, with a sexy and very cool persona and Daniel Ings as his inept elder brother, who manages to remain sympathetic while being very stupid!Joely Richardson is fabulous as the matriarch of the family and I have to say I think this is the best role I've ever seen Vinnie Jones play. He plays a really nuanced character, much much more than a mindless thug, and his chemistry with Joely sparkles.Too many other characters to mention but everyone is good and it is nice to set Nigel Havers popping up in a small role.Ray Winstone plays Ray Winstone but, for me, that's not a bad thing! The man with the cushiest jail set-up ever!In summary, this a very entertaining 8 episode romp and I think it will be the making of James, Theo James.",Guy triumphs again!
clarkie08,9,10 April 2024,"Loved the film, and love this series.Guy Ritchie, the marmite man it seems, but he rarely gets it wrong. Lock Stock, Snatch (best of the bunch), Rocknrolla, The Gentleman are all in the same vein. If you struggle with the Brit mob theme, maybe these films (and now TV series) arent for you.Brilliant fun, main characters sharp witty and keeps the whole thing ticking along. I flick through the reviews and people need to take life less seriously! A blast of a show, GR's signature cocky wit and charm, I personally can't wait for the second season. A refreshing break from all the heavy laden American shows. Thumbs up to this last jaunt.","Film one thing, series is in a league of its own."
JerryrFlanagan,10,29 March 2024,"I'm not even sure where to begin with this TV series on Netflix. The Gentlemen (2024) when aristocratic Eddie inherits the family estate, he discovers that it's home to a huge third party weed empire, and its proprietors aren't going anywhere. Theo James gives a brilliant performance as the new Duke, who not only inherits his father's wealth and estate but also all of his major problems in the first episode. Kaya Scodelario exudes a remarkable level of coolness and composure in each episode, leaving you curious if she will ever succumb to the pressure. Each time Daniel Ings' character, the brother of Duke Horniman, appears on screen, it guarantees a hilariously entertaining and over-the-top performance. That character clearly does not deserve to be the head of the family estate. This series is entertaining, witty, charming, and gruesome in a United Kingdom melancholy sort of way that only Guy Ritchie's team can bring to their audience.","Entertaining, witty, charming, and gruesome in a United Kingdom melancholy sort of way"
eliotmess,8,5 May 2024,"I haven't enjoyed previous Richie films so much because of the way they are edited, because they gloss over the plot holes with convenient happenstance. Come across as glib, against which I find combination of violence cynically naff. Like putting car chases in a dull movie.But I'm not fatigued by his style the way many critics seem to be.This series is much better than the original movie. The story has a chance to play out, rather than being slickly edited into a couple of hours.The casting is superb. Most of these actors are worth watching just within their own performances.

GCBH80,,13 March 2024,"One of the things I loved most about this series is how brilliantly Guy Ritchie captures the eccentricities and completely bonkers world of the British Aristocracy. It's genius lies, not only in a masterful script, brilliant cast and outstanding performances, but in the fact that this could very, very much be a true storyI would not be in the slighted bit surprised to learn how some of these toffs are keeping the family seat in the family and maintaining the upkeep of these (sometimes centuries old) piles - resorting to illegal, morally corrupt and ethically questionable business practicesA rollicking good laugh if you're willing to temporarily suspend disbelief and allow yourself to believe that there is a very real possibility some of this is quite possibly based on many versions of actual events.",Utterly Bonkers but Hillariously Funny

The Story was topnotch the twists albeit foreseeable were still pretty decent and I was quite encapsulated by the entirety of the show. It's a must see for any Guy Ritchie Fan.

nathansudds,3,22 March 2024,"The show starts off promising but quickly dissolves into nonsense. Every episode has the simple premise of a character giving the main character (MC) a quest. Such as ""I want this, oh ok go do this for me and you can have it"". It is followed by the most obvious resolution of MC trying to do it, encountering a problem, then killing someone. It is the most predictable events over and over. Even worse than this is that the characters are all completely void of logical reasoning. Every decision is just so stupid and illogical. I absolutely hate when characters are just stupid for the sole reason of progressing the plot.Finally the police dont exist and no consequences happen to absolutely anyone that does something bad because the police just dont exist in this. Everything is super convenient. There is always a super convenient plot hole to progress the story making everything I've already said even worse. The show also tries to look so bad azz of them being in a huge crime business and having access to so many evil connections.

Everyone is fully and totally into their roles turning the old Posh vs The Gutter narrative into a witty but dangerous dance.

Between the Meth Lord, the Authorities, the Crazed cocaine Preacher and keeping his wayward brother safe,Eddie has one heck of a dance keeping clear of everyone's guns.And the murders... are to be savored as the characters all need to be 'Saved by Jesus' the deeper it gets.But most of all, the dialogue is PRICELESS.

It truly is the tension of the writing that ties the knot to a viewers heart. I would go a tad less dark - and bring in a closer family theme- but hey clearly the vision and filming is a perfect ten to many viewers- as a writer and novelist I can only hope to score so big. Also, the wardrobes, set design and outside filming choices just all make the show not only a must watch- but a ""I want live in this world"" walk away!",Bravo = Cinematic Perfection
wdrptxddr,10,15 March 2024,"I'm on episode six of my second run through in less than a week. I watched it at home, am now visiting my cousin, so I didn't intend to do it that way, but here I am now looking up threads on Reddit because I wondered what others are getting from it because IT IS SO GOOD. Here's what I've noticed because I'm not schooled in filmmaking, but I'm always fascinated by the way any artist thinks when creating something, not just the final product. I like to know how things work, not just how they look.The first time I watched it all, I couldn't differentiate sometimes if a scene was so good because of the acting or the writing...or both. Susie Glass alone and her articulate way of putting someone on notice is breathtaking. But those words were written for her, although the words might have been lost on a lesser actor. In my second watching, the subtitles are on and that sometimes emphasizes how good the writing is, in addition to clarifying some things that are passed over the first time due to accents or the speed in which they talk. I live in the U. S., but listen to Brits daily-- there's a unique tone to any Guy Ritchie movie that requires attention to the words being spoken because that's simply the pace of each scene. Stories are often told rapidly-- subtitles help a lot even if you are British.The music and score is excellent-- I kept imagining how awe-inspiring it must have been in the studio when it was being recorded. All those voices in harmony are in perfect contrast with such a hard-core crime dramedy. Even though it was often operatic, it was still fast-paced opera, which, if on stage, would just seem weird. In The Gentlemen, it seems prophetic and often fore-shadowing what we could expect was coming. The beauty of the estate (a character in its own right) could be reflected in the beauty of the music-- both etherial on the outside, but harboring foreboding secrets underneath. If you heard the score by itself without ever watching the series, I think you could get a pretty good idea of the type of story being told.In my second run through the series, I'm really noticing a lot of the videography, as well. If I was a director, I would be so proud of some of those shots, like Chucky getting punched out by Jack (albeit, typical Guy Ritchie format-- slowly falling backwards to a thud on the floor), or the way the car door shuts and the camera is attached to the side mirror, while continuing to film Eddie driving away with a pissed off look on his face. If you really want to get deep, that last particular example is a metaphor for how much we actually get to see into Eddie as a person or his posh life in general. We are-- and always will be-- outside looking in through the glass because he shares next to nothing about his feelings. His face says it all. Again, great writing (through a lack of words), but definitely good directing.So, is it the writing, acting, directing, sound, or camera work that makes this so good? Sorry, I don't know the exact terms for the exact jobs that make a film come together-- I expect it takes a lot of people, especially in a Guy Ritchie film, but anyone should be able to tell the difference between a good actor and bad writing. In The Gentlemen, we're getting only good out of everyone's jobs on the film. I have nothing bad to say about any of it. The casting is SPOT effin ON, too.My point is, if you can remember to notice these things while watching the series, it's all done with quite a level of genius I haven't seen in filmmaking in quite a while. I absolutely loved Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and owned both on DVD back when that was a thing. And I'm female. I hope The Gentlemen wins tons of awards-- they deserve it. And Guy Ritchie just upped his game. I hope there's more to come.Oh, and Freddy is far less frustrating the second time through. You want to kill him a little bit less yourself with each episode.",Second Run Thoughts
adenwellssmith,9,17 March 2024,"The casting is good, the locations are good. Even the gags are good. It's certainly one that needs to get a second series. If you want a general feel for it, its a modern day Italian Job, with some pigeons thrown into the mix. There's the religious angle. There's also the Machiavellian whodunnit, with a bit of Lucrezia Borgia poisoning.The balls up was certainly one of the better gags I've come across in recent times.Hitler has only got one ball,
Göring has two but very small,
Himmler is rather sim'lar,

The show has some great comedy points and it has some minor action moments like most of his films. It's not as good as some of his more famous films but still very enjoyable. As for new shows out it's one of the best, especially on Netflix. It can seem a bit long at some points but never really boring.If you enjoy his movies I recommend giving the show a chance. Guy Ritchie can be a bit polarizing as a director so if you don't enjoy any of his work you will most likely not enjoy this show.",One of the better new shows.

The story follows a duke who must decide if he wants to exist in the zoo, or survive in the jungle with the lions and bears. From start to finish the series will have you engaged, and tells the story of how far man will go to protect his family, expand his empire, and be the master of his own destiny. The chemistry between our main Protagonist is great, and despite no romantic relations being found between the two, as a viewer you still hope that they will find a way to make up in the end.

Felt a little repetitive in the middle.. like here's a new episode and another favour needed so you need to deal with another new character.. this goes on for a few times. Also felt that really powerful scenes are far and few less! Like in the movie, the whole episode with Little finger and the wife or Raymond and the kids or the pound of flesh scene, they really were soo powerful.. but I felt this series could do with a few more of such scenes .. but nonetheless, the series was very entertaining, characters were as colourful as they can get in a Guy Ritchie's film and I really am looking forward for season 2 .. oh ., also Kaya was super cool and her character felt like it was mature version of her own Effy character from Skins!!",Awesome fun but misses powerful scenes

The show was a great venture into the aristocratic world while also touching the dark world of doing business in drugs, perfectly sprinkled with comedic and stylistic elements of what makes Guy Ritchie's work famous.At every second, you might find yourself at the edge of your seat. You'd come to love most of the characters and come to understand why some behave in certain ways. It's like hitching on a rollercoaster ride into the world of the drug syndicate.Be prepared for incredible acting on all fronts, topped off with an equally encapsulating plot!

It's too bloody for a romantic movie (which I bet it will turn itself into) too cheesy to be a gangster show. I don't know what audience they are aiming.

Lapseens,10,23 March 2024,"If you are like me - a lover of good, old black English humour, this series will serve you right and exactly down to its point. Guy Ritchie is never a let down, everything he touches and creates - is a success. Of course we have all our personal taste and opinions (as it fairly should be), and mine is nevertheless an another opinion amongst the millions of others. But my highlight to all the actors involved (cheers, mates!), is a delicious piece of gem to enjoy, juiceful and witty.. preferably together with a glass of red wine and perfectly cooked steak. Oh I hope there will be the second season.",It's just perfect.
davidhagerty1984,10,29 March 2024,"This is absolutely insane, brilliant and I love it. Peter serafinowic is amazing. Can't recommend enough. Completely classic Guy Richie and I've been waiting for this for years. Great to see Vinnie jones back in this space and playing the role he was made for. I hope this encourages more of these series to be created!If you're a fan of anything made by Guy Richie then this is an absolute must to watch.Peter Serafinowic with a scours accent is something that I can't quite get over, he did it very well, just a pity we didn't get to see him for longer in the series. If you watch one thing this year make it the gentleman. You will not be disappointed.",Classic Guy Richie
handcrafted,9,29 March 2024,"Interesting story and very tongue in cheek...reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino films...the killings the banter at each killing,discussing the Gainsborough painting,drinking tea,describing the watch and its history and the over the top winter BBQ eating the best beef ..
Guy Ritchie must have been influenced by Tarantino,no doubt about that.It's not a drama it's a black comedy so it's ok to have the killings the torture all the blood and gore it's not real life or a true story so it's ok to go into detail how to dispose of a body all with a smile and certain charm.All the cast must have had a fun time making this series.",Laugh out loud Black Comedy

koofasa,8,10 March 2024,"I see so many reviews talking about how clever this series is as pure entertainment. The comparison is to Breaking Bad which was a more serious story about a dying man's attempt to provide for his family that turned into a mega maniacal drama of drug lord driven by power. The Gentlemen is a well made series about the fall of western civilization where there estates of the British aristocracy are overtaken by lowlife drug lords making the aristocrats look like foolish clowns or court jesters in their own homes. It will be programs like this that future historians will look back on to point out some of the contributing factors in how the West fell. The series is really well cast and the production values are high. When you combine the British and American stories, you get the Western Empire which is no less than the Roman Empire in its scope and duration which will sadly meet the same end.",An homage to the collapse of western civilization
bajpaishlok,9,17 March 2024,"This fast paced crime drama is one of the best things Netflix has done in the past few years. It's an entertaining watch. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and leaves you wanting more. Would surely recommend giving it a go.It has a lot of sub plots, quirky characters and an all too familiar non linear storytelling style thanks to Guy Ritchie being one of the creators.If you liked the movie with the same name you will absolutely adore the show. Hopefully Netflix makes a second season because I would love to see Susie and Edwina carry on with their gobsmacking ways.Added cherry on the top is a peach of a finale.",Probably one of the best shows of the past few years.
nightringer-76840,9,13 March 2024,"What a signature film by Guy Ritchie!Humorous, thrilling, violent, and dramatic in Ritchie's style.Kudos to Theo James and Kaya Scodelario for carrying a heavy burden as 2 main characters. Their chemistry made this series a delightful series to enjoy.Theo James had made a splash on choosing the right series to star in lately. Counting The Expanse, The Astronaut's Wife, and now The Gentleman. His carried himself a tad monotonous, but very effective as the leading man.Scodelario had not been seen in a while. At first glance, you would thought that's Aubrey Plaza. But Kaya show cased her icy cold aura and cynicism to the character brilliantly. I couldn't help myself liking her evilness.Old friends also gathered in The Gentleman. It's weird to see Vinnie Jones without his usual yelling, but he was believable as soft spoken game master.In short: A MUST WATCH!!!!",Guy Ritchie's All The Way
Birminghamukengland,1,17 March 2024,"I had high hopes for this but got to the end of episode 3 and could stand no more.The acting, if you can call it that is atrocious. The lead man, His Grace with the beard is so boring, monotone and bland he almost sent me to sleep. All of the others aren't much better, the drug leader woman from the underground factory looked like a rabbit in a headlight at times, like she was going to forget her lines or something.The story, if you can call it that is juvenile, plain stupid and reminds me of the workings of a teenage boy who longs to be a Gangster but was actually born into the Aristocracy, oh, was it written by Mr Madonna Ritchie I hear you say. Poor Madonna, without her no one would have known who he was.The childishness of the plot got vey tedious and the drug using clown of a brother's character, talk about him over acting.Do not waste your valuable breath on this like I do.Absolutely pathetic.","Give it a rest Richie, same old same old."
simonwoodwrites,9,25 March 2024,"I love Guy Ritchie's LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS. And while he's had some good movies since, he's never managed to capture the magic of LOCK, STOCK. This TV show does! It's fun, serious, silly with all the hallmarks of Guy Ritchie's earlier films aka toffs, gangsters, potheads, gypsies, nutters, etc.The show has a solid story that is well mapped out over the eight episodes. The cast is great. Theo James does really well as the title character. He has a good presence and a nice command of the show.Overall, I loved it. This is one of the best shows I've seen in a long while and I do hope it comes back for a second season.",So Much Better Than The Movie THE GENTLEMAN
MajBlade2,9,11 March 2024,I really enjoyed this more then I have liked his movies. Its a bit slower at start but does move along. The acting was great Good story. Some of the accents lost me at times. But the mix of the old aristocrat families and the crime families was really interesting and enjoyed it immensely entertaining as the season goes on. Why Johnston who has 2.5 billion would worry about a 150 million pot business? Its illegal in the UK still so why take on the heat of police? The brother on brother thing was fun and you can see how these families have gotten so inbred and closeted while controlling millions of dollars.,Was better then expected
murlitaran,10,4 April 2024,"I eagerly delved into ""The Gentlemen"" series with high hopes and a tinge of apprehension. After all, the transition from silver screen to episodic storytelling is a formidable leap. However, having binge-watched the entire first season, I can confidently assert that ""The Gentlemen"" Season 01 not only lives up to its film counterpart but exceeds it in several aspects.Ritchie's signature style, characterized by sharp dialogue, intricate plots, and charismatic characters, translates seamlessly to the episodic format. From the outset, the series captures the essence of his cinematic universe while expanding upon it with newfound depth and complexity. Each episode unfolds like a meticulously crafted chapter, weaving together multiple storylines with finesse and flair.One of the most remarkable achievements of ""The Gentlemen"" series is its character development. While the film introduced us to the enigmatic figures inhabiting London's criminal underworld, the series delves deeper into their backstories, motivations, and interwoven relationships.Beyond its captivating characters, ""The Gentlemen"" series excels in its storytelling prowess. Each episode is a masterclass in narrative construction, blending suspense, humor, and intrigue in equal measure. From high-stakes heists to labyrinthine power struggles, the series keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating the next twist or revelation.Moreover, the episodic format allows for a deeper exploration of the series' themes and motifs. While the film touched upon issues of loyalty, betrayal, and the blurred lines between morality and criminality, the series delves even further into these themes, examining the consequences of ambition, greed, and the pursuit of power. The result is a narrative tapestry that is as thought-provoking as it is entertaining.Visually, ""The Gentlemen"" series is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography is stylish and dynamic, complemented by a pulsating soundtrack that heightens the tension and drama of each scene.In contrast to the film, which had to condense its narrative into a two-hour runtime, the series luxuriates in its episodic format, allowing for greater depth and nuance. Subplots are given room to breathe, secondary characters are fleshed out, and overarching mysteries are allowed to simmer and unfold gradually. The result is a more immersive and satisfying viewing experience that leaves audiences eagerly awaiting each new installment.As the credits rolled on the final episode of Season 01, I found myself already longing for more. ""The Gentlemen"" series is a triumphant evolution of Ritchie's cinematic vision, offering a rich and immersive narrative experience that surpasses its film counterpart in almost every aspect.Eagerly waiting for season 2.",Much better than movie
daveditch-53291,10,9 April 2024,"Implausible , even impossible in some areas and a bit far fetched at times but totally entertaining from begining to end. The characters are well cast , well developed , memorable and the actors playing them seem to bounce well off each other .Some absolute classic lines and scenarios (no spoilers ) all underpinned and carried along with a mixture of wanting to know what happens next , dark humour and a feeling of foreboding or ""oh no"".I think some people who want this to be a specific genre alone ie either a dark comedy , a drama , a gangster or a drug dealer series will be disappointed because it has a good mixture of all elements and you've got to accept your favourite parts you'd avidly watch are mixed equally with the bits you'd like to fast forward .Personally I loved it from begining to end and can't wait for the rumoured next series .Guy Ritchie has cracked it with this one.",A chicken with a shotgun ........isn't that always how these things kick off

Theres tension, cliffhangers, thrilling and hilarious moments every episode.The plot is original and clever. I'm going to be devastated when it's over! One minor issue for me is violence - I don't really enjoy things with too much violence, but in this it's levelled just about right and it wouldn't be as good without it.The acting performances are also on point. Each character is totally believable and follows through. There are two outstanding female characters Susie and Lady Sabrina. What a joy to see such positive female characters in key roles. Eddie plays the part straight, and is handsome and sexy. Freddy is hilarious as the ever optimistic addict - the actor is really well cast.In my view it's this years must watch of TV series - I just don't want it to end!",Absolutely outstanding!
highskye,9,2 April 2024,"Has it all. Great acting on the part of all the characters. It is loaded with dark humour. The two leads, Theo James as His Grace Eddie and Kaya Scodelario as Susie Glass have the bored smirk that is almost a smile or is it a grimace, down pat. They have an inside joke going between them, along some great sexual tension. Should they kill each other or make love? The series keeps you on the edge of your chair or sofa waiting waiting for the next, violent jack out of the box. And I was never disappointed. There isn't a weak actor among them. There is something to say about all of them, but I will pick two. They are Vinnie Jones and Michael Vu. Oh, and number three, his nibs played by Daniel Ings is Perfection.

It released when it seemed there was nothing a note on the platform and it gave a breath of fresh air. It's unique style translated from the film to the small screen is expanded on very well. It's tone, colors, theme and unique style all compliment each other. The acting especially from Theo James is on point, as you see the transition within him come to fruition from start to finish.

Sat through episode 1 because I'm stubborn, and because I wanted to see if it would improve. By the end I was slightly bored and suggesting better lines for the characters to say - yes, the script was that bad. It's not clever, it's not funny, it's just stupid. There is no reason why I should inflict the remaining episodes on myself. If you enjoy unredeemable, unbelievable characters with exaggerated accents shouting at eachother and cycling through the lexicon of offensive language, you'll love this, but otherwise the one star rating flatters it.","If this were on the BBC, I'd want a refund on the licence fee"

The clever writing keeps you on your toes with Guy Ritchie's signature rapid pace and sharp wit. It is funny, clever, gritty, funny, intelligent, entertaining, and did I mention it's funny? It shares many of the similar traits of his previous works - a complex narrative full of plot twists, an extremely colorful cast of characters, lots of quotable dialogue, and the inevitability that everything will spiral out of control. The story is fantastic, the dialogue is great, and the film is non-complicated but multi-dimensional. Some points are a bit ridiculous, and that makes it even better. Amazing characters, loved everything about it.","Hilarious, Intelligent, Fun"

nir661,9,13 March 2024,"Alright, listen up, folks! We gotta talk about ""The Gentleman"" - It's like crack for your TV addiction, I'm telling ya. I plowed through the first four episodes like a man possessed, and let me tell you, it was worth every damn minute.Right from the get-go, you're sucked into this whirlwind of charm, wit, and pure charisma. Guy Ritchie's fingerprints are all over it - from those cheeky text lines popping up on screen to the slick camera moves and the banter that's just on point.But let's cut to the chase, the real stars of the show are Eddie and Susan. Theo James as Eddie? Smooth as silk, dripping with charisma, and leading the pack like a boss. And Kaya Scodelario as Susie? She's got beauty, brains, and enough sass to light up the screen.Now, let's talk about Daniel Ings as Freddy. This guy? He's a revelation. Balancing Freddy's absurdity with the finesse of a tightrope walker, he's bringing the laughs but also some tears in a mishmash measure. And that chicken scene? Legendary stuff, my friends, one of the most memorable moments in the entire show.Sure, there might be a few plot holes here and there, but hey, who's counting? If you're not too hung up on being a total logic freak, you're gonna have a blast with this show.Overall? ""The Gentleman"" is like finding a twenty in your old jacket pocket - unexpected, but man, does it make your day. This show's got cult classic stamped all over it, like a tattoo you got after a wild night out. So grab a brew, park your butt on the couch, and let yourself get sucked into that cinematic whirlwind. Trust me, you'll be thanking me laterAnd hey, if you're still on the fence, just remember - life's too short for boring TV.

robdrummond,9,16 March 2024,"Americans may be bemused that to have a great Netflix series you don't have to have mass murders - mass shootings or loads of implausible car chases to have an interesting and unique series of highly enjoyable entertainment.Forgive me for saying but Guy Richie (ex / Mr Madonna (yes THAT Madonna)) has delivered his usual highly entertaining and enjoyable product to the market with a stellar cast including some from his very early days who totally fit in.Well done Guy and his team for bringing such originality to our screens / but in a very British way that eschews the ""bull crap"" that regrettably soaks up way too many American movies that include way too much gratuitous violence and (strangely) the worst marksmen (markswoman) where they seem incapable of actually shooting the ""hero"" but the hero manages to heroically hit the target bang onSo boringThanks Guy for yet another masterpiece.",Well - a decent series
celata-69624,10,22 March 2024,"Guy Richie is so back with a juicy, fresh, preposterous series that mesmerised my tribe for a week. We gave it a try despite the lousy synopsis and hesitant first episode but swallowed season 1 in only 4 days. Theo James and Kaya Scodelario lead the story impeccably. Eddie and Susie have this successful tension and awkward synergy in an endless rollercoaster, and Daniel Ings successfully makes us hate and love Freddy as if it was real. Joely Richardson and compassionate character Lady Sabrina balance the story without disappointment. And Vinnie Jones as Geoff is one of my favorite characters. What a man. Honestly I should mention everybody, Giancarlo Esposito was born to portrait Mr Johnston. With a brutally contrated music and a spectacular setting, this is a jewel in 2024 and we deserve a lot more of it. A lot more of Guy Richie! Brilliant.",Please give us more and more!!

Good actors like Giancarlo Esposito is wasted.No real tension at any point. What was The Duke's alternative plan for the Glasses? No mention of it even as he promises them they'd be richer by leaving his family and him alone.Every episode has a 'problem' that seems to solved quite easily and the violence feels sub-par to what we know Ritchie is capable of.All of which add to a totally pointless series. I can't imagine anyone being sad if they missed this sad excuse for a series. Especially when we know what Guy Ritchie is capable of.Like I said, it's a cash grab.

The final episode was also a treat and they wrapped that part of the story up nicely.Like the movie, the comedy elements really help to elevate the experience, I'm so pleased they did the movie justice here.

gillies,8,12 March 2024,"Im only 2 episodes into the series, which I'll call, *Breaking Bad UK"" in the NCIS Miami sense of the word. A desperate situation confronta a young man with a good heart, a new inheritance, a bad brother, and an unwitting woman drug dealer as his new partner. Like in the original series, everything gets just a little bit WORSE at the end of every episode, with plenty of dark humor and incompetence & drug dealers mixed in! Giancarlo Esposito - the world's #1 bad guy - ""gus"" in breaking bad - also stars and I'm sure they have something diabolical planned for him! Overall, if you don't get too invested in any side characters (who will be obviously expendible) and roll with the punches and irony and sutuation stupidity (a form of situation comedy) I think you'll enjoy this ride!I know nothing of Guy Ritchie.

AfricanBro,8,23 March 2024,"I'm not sure if Guy Ritchie has ventured into tv shows before but I'd love to see more. It's been a while since I've watched anything on Netflix and this has made me wanna check out more. It's one of those that makes you see the allure of being a criminal. Right from the first episode, I found myself on the edge of my seat. Before I forget I wanna say something from the early episodes that I loved is Ahmed's stare with his raised eyebrows. He's a very tense character.The writing is sharp and lively, keeping the pace fast and the viewer's attention. I enjoyed the lack of filler; each episode and scene felt purposeful, with no unnecessary monologues or dialogue. It's a tightly woven narrative and the pacing never slows down.There's a lot of characters dropping in throughout the season and their introductions handled pretty well. We encounter a wide range of personalities, from aristocrats to criminals to footmen. They're all memorable. What I loved is that each character, whether introduced in one episode or another, plays a significant role in the overarching plot. I loved the small side plot about the daughter. There's different characters to root for, despite most characters straddle the line between being morally ambiguous and outright criminal. I think only one character is truly innocent.I wouldn't say it's laugh out loud funny but there's good humor in this, with great action and opulent high class family crime drama. Some parts may stretch reality a bit, but overall, they're fun and well-executed.One thing I didn't like is how easily the number of houses were slipped out to other stakeholders. It's meant to be a well-kept secret, but by the end of the show, it feels like everyone knows. The season ends with a lot of twists, I thought the actual ending was a little over the top, but it was fine. I don't mind this being a mini-series, but I'd love a second season as well.Watching this series sparked a conversation with my friend about the allure of movies and shows about drug lords, especially when they're done well. They're thrilling and romanticize the criminal lifestyle. Id forgotten about the 2019 movie; so as I watched, it felt wonderfully familiar, like I'd enjoyed something similar before. Then it dawned on me. It's impressive how well the concept from the movie has been fleshed into a series. I highly recommend.",Lively and posh
broggoethe,8,28 March 2024,"Unlike a lot of people, I like Ritchie's style. Action, good music, good actors, what's not to like?Basically, a Duke finds out his father, after his death, has been allowing weed to be grown on his 15000 acre estate and making a lot of money on the side.The idea that Eddie (the Duke) wanted to get his family out of the game just wasn't believable, and you knew from the start he'd end up getting sucked into the life. Again, he's close to being a psychopath with his unflinching nature toward violence, and as his brother tells him later, he was born for this. On top of that, his mother already knows about the business and doesn't care, even helping with some of their problems. His brother actively wants to stay in. Eddie has no wife or children he's protecting. So what's the conflict here? Of course he's going to ultimately want to keep going, and it takes eight episodes to bring that to an end, so, a little drawn out.Still, the show is a lot of fun. The way the show ends seems like it almost demands a second season, and given its performance so far, it feels like it is likely to get one. .",Gentlemen Prefer .....Weed
AudioFileZ,8,25 March 2024,"The Gentlemen, the 2019 movie was a very entertaining Guy Ritchie addition to his reliably well-received UK gangster collection of films. Cracking good cast with a bit of a well done wicked humor separating it from others, including all imitators. As such, one might ask why redo it? With the solid basic drug related foundation a series offers much more real estate to flesh out an even better story.So, in 2024 we get Ritchie's Netflix series of the same name. Once again we get an exceptional cast. This time the mix of the same premise gets the long-form. And, in this longer telling of a novel underground UK weed operation there's time to develop the characters quite well. Carried by the trio of Theo James, Kaya Scoelario, and Daniel Ings their characters of Eddie Horniman, Susie Glass, and Freddy Horniman admirably propel this 8-episode retelling of The Gentleman - often it seems better than the movie. Adding gobs of twists and deceit along the way, this version hardly lags, even at eight episodes. In fact, it's addicting to watch leaving one hoping for another season. Definitely one of the best things I've seen on Netflix.",Episodic Version of The Gentlemen Is Great
facehek75,8,12 March 2024,"The series is a well made film with some good acting and creative stories. The interplay between the actors stands fast and gets really interesting with each Serie, as the story develops along the lines of an expanding ambition of men who can have a say in their society and that want to advance in their quest for more of everything in life. Susie Glass supplies the female interest and a good bit of natural intelligence to the story, well played by a young actress with great potential. Vinnie Jones and Ray Winstone supply a good dose of star studded presence, which raises the quality of the show a but higher and makes it more appealable to all characters. While character is something the show does not lack and the gentlemen certainly hold their own for a manly spectacle of rowdy gangs of English world and rough guys who never let you down.",Awesome show for tough guys

It thinks it's clever but is utter garbage and makes me feel dumber for having suffered through the episodes.Guy Ritchie is trying so hard to be Tarantino and it's blatantly obvious, he ultimately misses the mark on so many levels.I feel like this is only getting such high reviews because of the hype surrounding it, as the actual story and acting is beyond diabolical.All a bit too 'posh boy who thinks he's a cockney gangster' for me.

It is a show with everything in it, witty comedy, disturbing parts, extreme violence and sometimes, they are all in one scene. I saw the movie when it came out, and I enjoyed it, however I remember being a little disappointed by the end of the movie, just couldn't place my finger on what I felt was missing. Now this series, it was brilliant, gets you hooked easily, acting as very good, the 2 leads were tremendous, (Theo James-Divergent series & Kaya Scodelario-Maze Runner series). And how can one not love the irony of Giancarlo Esposito playing a meth king pin... AGAIN like in Breaking Bad and even running shady side scams to position himself on top as a drug lord. That alone is worth the admission, I love Guy Ritchie style of movie telling. The one thing this show in my opinion did NOT do, is have a bunch of filler parts to get you to the hour of each episode, the story telling all tied in and was relevant to the story. Compared to all the Star Wars & Marvel shows flying out on Disney that is half filler and not really relevant.",Better then the Movie!
arabnikita,8,14 March 2024,"The Gentlemen: Season 1 (2024)Gentlemen was one of my favorite films of the past 5 years and when I heard that Netflix was going to turn it into a TV show, I couldn't help but feel bewildered. Years have passed and it has finally come out but strangely enough, it wasn't a waste-of-time cheap cash grab that I thought it would be. While it's way below the criminal bar that Guy Ritchie is known for, it was quite an enjoyable evening past time and I wouldn't mind watching a second season.The story is about Eddie Horniman, who inherits his family estate after succeeding his father as the Duke. Pretty soon he discovers that his father wasn't a simple aristocrat and over the years, he established a partnership with a drug cartel that built a weed farm underneath the vast estate. While he wants to be out of this business; unfortunately, the current circumstances he finds himself in, make the exit strategy slightly complicated. The first episode hooked me right away and as the story progressed the criminal web became a lot more tangled.Naturally, this web is filled with a number of interesting spiders from various nationalities and backgrounds played by a nice cast of actors. Everyone was very stylish and overall the series looked quite polished. While the narrative was interesting, it lacked that zesty electric feel that we all loved in the film. The overall experience sometimes felt like a set of quests because the story needed to be stretched out over 10 episodes instead of a quick 100 minute movie.The dialogue was well put together but it lacked Guy Ritchie's iconic razor sharp wittiness. Consequently, despite occasional hilarious moments, the humor also felt quite tame as it was a Netflix series and Guy was obviously restricted in terms of what the characters could say. Nevertheless, the series kept me engaged the entire time and delivered an enjoyable ending making me curious to see where the story goes from there.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and tv show reviews.",A lot better than expected

That said, after watching the show...I believe this is what GR would say it should have always been. Young up and comers, being played/mentored by the old guard, vs watching the old guard fight amongst themselves.I've always respected Theo James, and thought his best performance to date was White Lotus...I stand corrected, he IS EDDIE HORNIMAN. The chemistry between him and Kaya on screen, and then him and Daniel was absolutely (insert chefs kiss) incredible. The whitty, funny, and dry banter was so much fun to watch.On top of the acting, the storyline just got better and better.

The actors all do an incredible job, very career defining and very on point, accompined by a stellar script for sure.The cinematography, cutting and editing is incredible, very feature worthy and overall very beautifully put together.Overall, definitely an incredible show, that I would highly recommend!",Great recounting of the film

So, thats all typical Guy Ritchie stuff and one should not expect him deviating from what he does best. It's not everyone's cuppa, I hear you on that one, but for those who understand an artist's need for fingerprint impressions on his work, will know what to expect.

classicsoncall,8,4 April 2024,"This series is seen as sort of a sequel to director Guy Ritchie's 2019 movie of the same name, and while maintaining the same basic premise, all the players have changed with Theo James in the principal role of Eddie Horniman, named in his father's will as the new Duke of Halstead Manor, bypassing older and less capable brother Freddy (Daniel Ings). The series strength is also its weakness, by presenting a large cast of humorously despicable characters, unless you virtually binge the series one chapter after another, it's kind of hard to follow the continuity from one to the next. At least I found that to be so, but because I keep notes to help me with my reviews, I was able to pick up the thread when I had to set the story aside for a day or two. Typical for a Ritchie vehicle, you can look forward to the usual assorted mayhem and bloodshed, generally quite creative and sometimes quite unexpectedly. In her role as overseer of the Glass family weed operation at Halsted Manor, Kaya Scodelario as Susie Glass serves as both an ally and foil to His Grace Eddie, who wants to divest from the marijuana operation, but finds it impossible to do so due to the machinations of various other outlaw factions in competition for the lucrative business. Through it all, Eddie maintains a stoic presence as he straddles the line between the law and his very obvious departure into criminality. It's a good series, but because it extends over eight episodes, some of the Guy Ritchie punch loses some steam at points along the way. You might want to brush up on your British colloquialisms, as the dialog gets really humorous as the action ramps up.","""Enjoying your little sojourn into the murky world of criminality?"" - Ep. #4, Susie Glass to Eddie Horniman"

The production possesses all the foundational aspects common to superior film works: clever and engaging writing, superb cinematography, adroit direction, wise casting, magnificent acting, stirring sets and a dedication to the small details. This cornucopia of darkness is presented with that always delightful British Isles dryness.I applaud Netflix for greenlighting this series - it is arguably their best self-produced effort.As a general FYI, new Land Rover models are available in more hues than merely Henry Ford-approved black ;).PS - for those not familiar with ""Snatch"" and other Guy Ritchie flicks, this series is absolutely NOT appropriate for sub-teens (and perhaps young teens, too).","A Posh (with uppercase ""P"") ""Snatch"""

I am always entertained when Vu is on screen, and I am a little bit concerned for Ings because I am not 100% sure he is merely acting.But the two main pretty boy/girl are a tad wooden and one-dimensional. Theo James and Kaya Scodelario's job appear to be to stand there and deliver their lines while looking beautiful, and occasionally smirk. Which is a bit of a shame because I came into this as a big fan of Scodelario from Skins and I'm pretty sure she has more range than what is being shown here. It almost seems like the director is playing dressup with her, putting her in a new costume in EVERY. SINGLE. SCENE. To distract us from the fact that she doesn't bring anything else new or interesting to the table from one scene to the next.But I'm not entirely convinced these acting flaws are actually acting, or the way their characters are written/directed. Either way, you'd only have to be REALLY looking to notice them like I am, because otherwise the show is incredibly entertaining, lots of cool effects like drawings on the screen, interesting directing choices.And plots, settings, a storytelling-style and gratuitous violence reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.If you like anything else rated 8/10 on IMDB you'll love this.",Pulp Fiction 2.0

It started very well, with a strong cast with some well matched talents. The big surprise for me was Theo James, who I had seen in Divergent and a Jane Austen story where he seemed miscast. I really liked him in this, he is smooth and laid back and wields an iron fist in a velvet glove to perfection. And I never noticed how good his voice is before: he is posh, but not annoyingly so, unlike some actors I won't mention here.The other standout for me is Kaya Scodelario, whose accent complements him perfectly. I never noticed her in the Divergent series, this is a series where she can really make her mark, and I don't think Guy Ritchie has explored her relationship with Theo much at all at this stage.The plot is what you would expect from Guy, but because it is a series the violence is interspersed with many other happenings, not least of which the chicken episode was the most hilarious (in a dark kind of way).It did drag a little bit at the end, but not enough to stop me watching.

It has been awhile since Netflix produced such an entertaining piece of work without compromising the plot's intricacy.

This show achieves the ""paradoxical reconcilliation"" between the two aspects. That said, there might be some hiccups at the beginning in term of storyline but in general the setting, chemistry and actings of characters are on point.

The writing keeps you engaged with clever dialogue baazi and gritting performances.Episode 1 sets up the plot and it's straight forward narrative, and with each episode you get hooked to the adventures and absurd drama.There are nostalgic moments from Snatch, Rock n Rolla along with the super titles of the action, characters and paraphrases along with whiskey, wine, shots and beautiful cinematography.",Guy Ritchie writing-directing a show.

And partially due to a significantly more relevant casting, where actors fit well even when playing grotesque characters.And partially due to the story being told in a due course of 8 episodes, having enough time to unravel and wind towards it finale.Good watch overall - maybe not an instant classics, but a solid unwilling outlaw story, with many scenes referencing previous Guy Ritchie's works.",Much better than the movie

Its not horrible, its just not as good as it started.Now with the pros, this series is greatly acted, produced and directed!

Pigeon_down,4,18 March 2024,"The Gentlemen - It start and droops very quickly from there.I think Ritchie is re-releasing his greatest hits album again, but shot in a pub using only a banjo. This series features the usual suspects of Ritchie character - yes, the scousers, the gypsies, the London gangsters, the Americans, Russians etc. In the midst of this is the Duke and his family. It's basically the same caper set up from past movies in which they find themselves in a woven predictament they must unpick. However, the clock on this never feels pressing. Further, the reveal at the end is such a let down. The last quarter of the series really just bumbles toward a deflated narrated conclusion, it's closer to Scooby doo as an ending where Velma gets to explain how it was the caretaker all along and here's how she figured it all out.Expect lots of what appear to be plot gaps, pieces that remain unexplained. Why does the Duke want out? What is his plan to make the Glass family richer? Why does he decide to stay in on something he was so opposed to? Why do the Scouse Gospel crew withdraw from the murder of their brother based on nothing more than a phone call? It assumes lots going on behind the scenes that you're not told about.It tries to bring an almost Ocean's Eleven style climax, but the reveal is weak, really weak. I struggled through the last episode because nothing was happening, it degenerated from a show to a narrated story.There's nothing new in this.

However, that alone is far from enough.What led me to abandon this series halfway through, something I typically dislike doing, was the decisions made by the characters.You have these characters who are portrayed as successful, wealthy, and supposedly skilled in their criminal careers... yet they consistently make the most idiotic decisions imaginable. Every. Single. Time.Sure, making a mistake is something that happens, but it's baffling to see these major criminal organisations seemingly incapable of hiring a competent delivery person, among other unbelievable occurrences.These nonsensical decisions, made by characters who are supposed to be successful, are incredibly distracting and frustrating.Of course, the bar has been set so low with the successful characters making these absurd mistakes that one can only imagine the level of stupidity exhibited by those who are supposed to be stupid.",So many stupid decisions it's offensive

Some of it is just pedestrian, some is genuinely bad and not helped by the director's penchant for caricaturing and stereotyping characters.

OHGOD_NOT_THE_BEES,4,13 March 2024,"Bit divided on this one.On one hand it has it's (rare) moments, on the other hand it kinda feels like a modern pop song, that lacks dynamics due to quantizing.It just is all one one loudness level and none of the characters really pulls me in to root for them (except one, but he just has like 10 minutes)So after there is that >ah, i guess Ritchie remembered, that everybody loved the Gypsies in ""Snatch""< moment (turns out a lot of that charm was carried by the actors and in the show...well...it doesnt work out that well), there are a few good/funny/memorable scenes underlined by well picked music, a female lead, who talks like a goddess ( I mean it! She is glorious), a male lead, who is rather stereotypical and forgetable (which is a shame, because Ritchie could have played with our expectations regarding the good looking over achiever, but nope..he is just that), an over the top, yet clichee, but somewhat funny weed grower, and besid that the biggest emotional moment (for me) in ""You killed Jethro! You bastards!"", there is really not a lot that stayed with me.After the chicken dance, which admittedly got SO much more intense and bizarre than i expected, the show falls in in kind of a trott without any real highs or lows.It dabbles a bit to the funny, then it dabbles a we bit in the skuril, then it dabbles a bit to the dark, then it dips its toes a bit in to gore, but without really commiting to any.It has a lot of nice, cinematic camera work and A LOT of slowmo shots, but starting mid season the soundtrack as a tool to underline all these nice shots and contextual dynamics completely loses its purpose and, in fact, becomes a driver for the feeling of indifference i developed for the plot and the characters.Over all i miss the commitment to edgy dialoges, bizarre, quirky characters and dark punchlines in combination with well picked music, that I connect to the name Guy Ritchie. And when the show TRIES to achieve it, the results are a wee bit clumsy (like that machete swinging car trader).It still can be fun to watch i guess, because it IS well made (from a technical perspective) but personally I found it rather bland and - for Ritchies standard - too tame and mainstream.

The plot is beyond ridiculous and resisted my every attempt to suspend disbelief and just enjoy it. Also the episodes are repetitive and feel like one idea repeated over and over with small variations. The villains are unscary, goofy stereotypes.Ritchie seems to think that just juxtaposing different classes of British people in various crime scenarios will create interest and fun contrast.

Fussy edits, slow motion shots, split screens, and the like were not new when Ritchie used them a generation ago to try to gain fame.

Ritchie should have taken his cue back then.Now we get the bag of tired tricks in an overlong series that loses its momentum very early, as in the second episode, and runs out of steam completely by the third. There is shockingly little character development, even in the major roles, and the thinnest of plots to tie together all the randomness.And then you realize that was always the problem with Ritchie. All his fussy hand waving film gestures exist to distract the audience from the void of basic storytelling at the core of Ritchie.

Sleep inducing with a mediocre cast. What else can I write about it? Need 195 more characters ffs. I think those who loved it probably are a bit simple. There is so much better than this 25 year old tired Guy( he's a post bloke really) Richie rubbish. It's nothing new . Avoid.,Absolute twaddle
gilleliath,1,21 April 2024,"This is the kind of show where you feel a little of your soul dying with every episode. Listening to the dialogue is like being staked out on a termite mound - especially the girl, Susie Glass. She gets all the most excruciatingly awful lines, though I suspect that Guy Ritchie thinks he is giving her the best ones. He has no idea how real people talk, or live, what their frame of reference is, or anything. This is a wet dream come true for him, combining his bit-of-rough fantasies of cockernee criminal life with his own posh, entitled world.So why are we all watching it?

boriska_gn,3,17 March 2024,"An unfunny absurdist comedy instead of a crime drama
I started watching this series because it was positioned as a crime drama. In the first episode, it was still difficult to classify it as a crime drama, but overall it was quite watchable. But soon, comedic and absurd elements appeared. Over time, they became more and more numerous. I can't say that I don't really like the satirical genre at all, but it's clearly not something that I can watch 10 episodes of. Moreover, to be honest, the humor was pretty stupid in most of the jokes. By the end of episode 2, this comedy began to tire with the abundance of all this.",An unfunny absurdist comedy instead of a crime drama

Regulated and taxed like they are growing and selling veggies. The acting is good. The story started funny and unique. It kind of lost me on the 4th episode. It started to look like a poor man's breaking bad... The characters started to look like cartoon characters of drug dealers. By episode 5 it seemed to loose focus and humor. The story became unbelievable and ridiculous that they would do these things.. very far fetched ... Sorry couldn't buy it at the 6th...,Hard to relate .
pete-489,3,21 March 2024,Really had high hopes for this as I loved the movie. First episode was OK but it just went downhill after that. I think the series should have been titled: Morons and Psychopaths. By episode 3 it had stopped being fun to watch. I did manage to finish all the episodes but really regret that I did. It kinda washed away the good taste of the movie. Most of the characters were interesting for a while but that interest waned the more the series went on and even Vinnie Jones looked like he phoned his part in. The series really turned out to be disappointing after such high expectations. I have to wonder if I watched the same series as all these 10/10 reviewers.,"Wow, this was a mess"
porkotyler,1,3 April 2024,"I believe all pieces of art (including shows) should have at least a shred of philosophy behind them. A deeper meaning that will linger in the mind of the viewer. This show has none. It's all style but no substance. The characters are all shallow and irredeemable. There's no catharsis.Let's take the main protagonist for example. The young Duke starts of as a paragon. The stereotypical good guy who wants to look after his loved ones in a corrupt world. His father made a shady business deal which he disapproves of for the entire show and tries to get out of. He slaps his brother for killing another man and calls him a murderer. He gets angry when he learns Susie Glass killed that kid on the boat. He accepts the responsibility of the Dukedom (and in the process disinherits his corrupt brother) on the premise that he's the best son who can get the family out of their nasty situation.Does he achieve this goal? Does he die trying for the sake of his principles? No, none of that. He doubles down and becomes even worse than the gangsters his father worked with. He kills his way to the top and buys out all the other crime syndicates. This guy spent the entire show trying to get out of this business deal and ends up becoming the Don of all Dons.You might ask: Does he do it out of necessity because his experiences changed him? No, he does it for pleasure. Turns out he was always like that since he was a kid. The guy LOVES killing and stealing. He loves the thrill of running a criminal empire. This makes the Duke look like a phony and a hypocrite. He's not even an anti-hero. He's a straight up villain. I was rooting for him for the entire first season but in the end he became insufferable.Another thing that irked me was how cool the Duke's mother was with all of this. She hated the deal her husband made with the Glass family. She spent the entire season trying to find ways to get out of it just like her son did. Then all of a sudden the Duke announces to her that he's about to buy out all the other criminals and became their boss and she's like ""good let's do this"". These people did a complete 180 in the span of the last half of the season finale.The season finale even solidified the Duke's fall from grace by having Susie Glass hand him a gun in order to execute a rival mobster. He does it without even looking with a SMILE on his face. This dude LOVES murder. It undermines the entire preachy and ""holier-than-thou"" attitude the Duke maintained throughout the show. What an absolute bimbo this guy was after all.",All style but no substance.

""ChatGPT write me a ganster drama in the style of Guy Ritchie"". You'll get The Gentleman. Mildly entertaining in the early part but grows old fast. Over the top characters with too much dialogue. Monologues about animals (pigeons in this case, where it was pigs in Snatch). Ritchie still thinks he's the English Taratino but he's really not. His movies were good in the 90s & 2000s but very of the their time. The Gentleman is just recycled Guy Ritchie hits & largely forgettable. No doubt it'll satisfy the algorithm though & get another series for all the fan boys much like other UK Netflix shows... ahem, looking at you Afterlife.",Guy Ritchie plays the hits

I have to watch this with captions on because I can't understand all the mumbled dialog, and still the British slang is taking me out of the film.

jamericanbeauty,4,27 March 2024,"The Protégé. The Fixer, Kind of. But he's not The Gentleman running anything or calling the shots. I enjoyed the movie of the same name and I enjoyed the first two episodes penned by Guy Ritchie. Thereafter, the not Guy Ritchie-written episodes fell off a cliff. I love Theo James. Hollywood still has not utilized him properly. He'd make a perfect Bond. James Bond. Here, he's a Duke for Hire and does whatever tasks assigned to him from The Weed Boss Lady (played by an actress who's name is impossible to spell). She was great in a series called Spinning and she's good here. I just don't like the work dynamics going on here. What is The Duke's standalone storyline? His entire character arc runs through the Weed Boss Lady. She's basically his mentor. Why would she send The Duke off on a low-level job to steal a car from a dangerous enterprise? Why would she risk his life or clean record or good standing when she operates a lucrative weed business out of his mansion? Why is The Duke's big Brother still around past Episode 2 or 3 at best? The actor's fine in the role, but he has nothing to do, which means he's not needed. The weed farm guy with the off accent is too high out of his mind to be put in control of a lucrative weed farm 24-7. Where's the muscle? Why wouldn't his boss, The Weed Boss Lady, track him or his phone to catch the pretty crook who stole his van with the big weed delivery? Who would trust an out of his mind weed head with such a delivery in the first place? Why does the show keep having The Duke clean up one mess, just to create a bigger mess? It's repetitive and predictable. All of the eccentric personalities and over-the-top scenarios could not distract me from the bad writing and redundancy. Not even Vinnie Jones, Theo James, and criminally underused Giancarlo Esposito and Ray Winstone could hook me past Episode 4. I've never met a Guy Ritchie project I didn't find interesting and entertaining. He may be an executive producer, but outside of the first two episodes he wrote, this doesn't feel like Guy Ritchie. It's trying too hard to be shocking and cool. Guy Ritchie projects don't try. They are.",The Apprentice.
mps-09977,5,18 March 2024,"I was a big fan of Guy Ritchie because of his first couple of movies and his Sherlock Holmes movies.I grew up in the criminal underworld and spent some time involved in it as a young adult.His first films were gritty and authentic. His characters seems like people I actually knew. Albeit, a little exaggerated, but not far from what real criminals are like. The movies just felt like they could be real. For whatever reason, he was in touch with the realworld criminal element.But then he just started making movies with outlandish criminal types that only exist in the minds of people who have never even met a criminal.That is what this show is. And the movie.Which is fine, it's just not why I liked his movies, or why I placed value on anything that had his name on it.This show is also fine. It's entertaining enough and I'm sure people will like it, but it's just like any other out of touch criminal story.

paulwalters-24,1,26 March 2024,"This show is all over the place. I watched till episode 5 and that pretty much did it for me.The premise is as per description, a duke inherits from his father, finds illegal operation running on his property, and due to certain circumstances, allows it to continue. This is all great until you actually start watching further, and episode by episode, you can feel the story degrading in quality.The main character is shown as a mature, reasonable and intelligent man, who would take rational decisions until he is forced to do otherwise. This development takes a complete u-turn, and now he would be willing to participate in illegal activities without there being any urgency attached to it.From what I've seen, here is a breakdown of the template that this show follows -
-Main guy or his associates get in trouble.-Need help from someone to sort it out.-Go to that person, but they demand something else in return, essential a secondary task.-Perform secondary task where usually someone dies.-Go back to the first person and take reward.-Get into more problems with that person, which is essentially a twist to the whole episode's development.A few good things that can be said about the show is the cinematic experience, especially in the first 2 episodes. Music is average and often plays too loudly over the dialogue. Some actors are not fit for their role, and some good actors are used very less.",An Insult to the viewers
MissyTheCat,5,30 March 2024,"If you like Guy Richie, then you'll probably like this as there really isn't anything new presented here.Of course it is based on his film, so it will be very familiar, but it is like he hasn't had any new concepts since he started way back with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Odd ball gangsters, pretentious displays of wealth, overly serious scenes by said pretentious characters, stated silly bits of trivia to display the gangsters are ""intelligent"", on screen text to show us math and ""amusing tidbits', nonlinear editing in the timeline to try and save a otherwise dull scene, About every other scene has someone pouring a decanter into a crystal glass of some sort, etc. Again, it is a re-hash of much of Richie's past gimmicks, but if that is your cup of tea, then you'll probably like this and forgive its various missteps.The story is of a soldier/aristocrat who inherits his fathers title and land only to discover his father was in bed with a large illegal marijuana enterprise. So our handsome protagonist dives in trying to separate his family from this business. This gives the filmmakers plenty of opportunities to introduce a variety of underworld types, many of whom we've seen in the past from Richie. Each episode works its way to solving this problem, but by episode 6, it grows old. Also, they have a tendency to introduce issues, big issues, that seem to be swept under the carpet at the filmmaker's convenience which left me scratching my head.Since it is a gangster film, I was looking for a great shootout at some point, but even that wasn't given to us, although it was set up more than once. I also assumed that as the lead was a soldier there would be a chance to see his skill in a fight from time to time, but this came up only once or twice I did like that he would solve problems with his head first, but I was still hoping for some more action.Because of issues in the script the ending was more frustrating rather than satisfying. But it looks great, the wardrobe is topnotch so our leads look like they stepped out of a page of a fashion magazine (except for the big, silly square glasses many wore looking more like the old man from Up, then suave gangsters), several locations are very striking and they drive some wonderful antique cars from time to time.

manutdjp,1,10 April 2024,"Now I remember when Guy Richie made good original British gangster movies. Lock stock and Snatch are 2 of my favourite British movies and even did ok with the Sherlock Holmes reboot with Robert Downey Jr. However he doesn't seem to be able to adapt a rather weaker of his films 2019 The Gentlemen to the small screen, although TG film does have some good moments, it doesn't flesh out the characters like his earlier work. Which brings me to 2024 and the most pointless overused one shot opening to a series. WHY?? I was expecting a shoot out at the army check point, but no just being told his dad is dying and to come back from service. BTW , why did he not go back to army after coming back for funeral? Must have had a generous general. Anyway shock horror he had been left the estate, and not the drug fueled renegade brother who's birth right is to inherit the whole fortune. I am not making this up, this passes for a original,plausible plot nowadays. The rest of the 1st episode follows the paint by numbers plot and 2 dimensional characters whose only purpose is to keep the plot (over used story arc going). Honestly go back and watch his classic LSATSB and Snatch as this ain't it. We end the 1st episode with the most long drawn out scene of a guy in a chicken suit pretending to be a chicken who ends up shooting someone with a shotgun. Is this a comedy? Gangster thriller? It just ends up being nothing and waste of some talent from the actors trying to do the best with the script, although not convinced by the lead who always looks like he is thinking of something interesting to say but never really says it.

coles_notes,5,25 March 2024,"Created and directed by Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Sherlock Holmes) and starring Theo James as the lead, we follow Edward Horniman, the second son of a wealthy English landowner who is given his estate upon his death, superseding his older brother, and unknowingly also inheriting the past black market criminal relationships of his father. I liked previous Guy Ritchie stuff, so a longer form series certainly peaked my interest. Unfortunately it follows many of my initial fears in that it ends up feeling more a 10 hour, 10-act movie, than it does a properly paced serial. Expecting Ritchies usually punchiness in style, we do get that, but its so drawn out that at times the show feels a crawl, I was surprised how bored I often was. The characters are all turned up to eleven, which was to be expected, but tonally its not quite as funny or satirical as I've felt his other works have landed, sometimes it does feel a bit too macho serious, at others just goofy. Production-wise its top notch. Definitely high budget, looks very pretty, all the suits and outfits are very cool, as of course are the sets. There were some of the post-production choices I didn't like, namely the directors notes writing over the top of some scenes (very Guy Ritchie), especially where it just felt like the writers thinking they were really clever and over-explaining plot. Ritchie is a great director, and if you like his style, you'll like his work in this. Every shot feels unique, he clearly spent a lot of his focus there. Unfortunately the writing, characters, dialogue, not my favourite. The main plot being the classic never ending fetch quests for macguffins, this time from crime boss to new crime boss. Very bland, surface level characters, all tropes. Again could be argued was for the sake of satire but I don't really buy it. In the end, it was competently made, but I don't think it was good, especially on a narrative level. All said I didn't even realize until more than half way through this that it was actually a spin-off of another 2019 Guy Ritchie film of the same name. Should I watch that? Will it re-contextualize everything for the better? I'd guess not, but as for this, if it seems like your kinda thing it probably is. Wasn't mine.",Average

jeroen-106,5,3 April 2024,"Guy Ritchie's venture from the big screen to the streaming platform with ""The Gentlemen"" (2024) offers a visual spectacle, true to his trademark style, yet leaves a void where the essence of its story should reside. Filmed across iconic locations including London, Badminton House, and the historical Longcross Studios, the series is nothing short of a feast for the eyes, enveloping viewers in a world that's as stylish as it's meticulously curated.With a reception that teeters on the edge of general favorability (71% on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 67), the series embodies Ritchie's penchant for slick, polished narratives that, while entertaining, skate on the surface of its characters' depths. The performances, especially by Kaya Scodelario, inject a much-needed vitality into the series, portraying a character with a semblance of arc and complexity amidst a sea of underdeveloped personas.However, the central figure, played by Theo James, becomes emblematic of the series' struggle - a protagonist lost in a narrative that dazzles without depth, where the allure of coolness overshadows the potential for character growth and emotional resonance.""The Gentlemen"" manages to be both engaging and monotonous; it's a paradox of entertainment that captures Ritchie's cinematic flair but falters in delivering a compelling narrative. As viewers traverse through the series, the excitement of the crime-laden plot gives way to a realization of its superficiality, leaving one to ponder the potential of its untapped depths.In sum, while ""The Gentlemen"" succeeds in being a visual treat and a testament to Ritchie's distinctive style, it underscores the quintessential challenge of balancing form with substance.

Don't care about the acting, directing, camera, plot, etc, the violence and aggression is just too much that it makes all of those things irrelevant.It's similar to the negative reaction of Game of Thrones.Since most of the movies and tv shows are US/UK based, just to note that this reaction is not coming from some religious thing (don't know why that's the assumption in the US anyway).I though the show might be funny, but it is not, the ""funny"" part is the part that makes all the violence/aggression/humiliation/torture seem casual, and that is just.. ugh... no more, no thanks...",Too violent
akcenat,4,31 March 2024,"Guy Ritchie brings his signature flair to the small screen with ""The Gentlemen"", a crime drama series that expands on the world introduced in his 2019 film. While boasting strong production values, the show suffers from gratuitous violence and an off-putting, irreverent tone.Visually, ""The Gentlemen"" is a treat, with Ritchie's kinetic directing style translating well to the episodic format. The show's sleek cinematography and stylish editing effectively immerse viewers in the seedy underbelly of British high society. The production design is also top-notch, from the lavish country estates to the gritty urban locales.The cast, for me, was a mixed bag; the cast members, including Ray Winstone and Vinnie Jones, and many others, delivered just solid performances and nothing more, while some were wrongly discussed.Also, the show's writing is problematic. While Ritchie's trademark witty dialogue is present, it often feels forced and overly explanatory. Characters frequently engage in long-winded speeches that disrupt the pacing and appear unnatural. Additionally, the plot is occasionally convoluted, with various schemes and double-crosses challenging to follow. But, The most significant issue with ""The Gentlemen"" is its gratuitous violence and mean-spirited tone. Several scenes feature graphic, over-the-top brutality that feels unnecessary and exploitative, particularly those involving Susie's sadistic enforcer Clarissa Jones. Moreover, the show's attempts at dark humour often veer into cruelty, with characters like the mocking Jimmy constantly belittling others. The series also features a troubling undercurrent of disdain for Christianity, with a gang leader, Gospel John, as a character for the director to openly mock the faith.In conclusion, ""The Gentlemen"" is a stylishly produced crime drama that ultimately fails to live up to its potential. Despite the money poured onto it and impressive visuals, the show is weighed down by uneven writing, excessive violence, and a mean-spirited tone. While fans of Ritchie's work may find elements to enjoy, the series' flaws prevent it from being a wholly satisfying viewing experience. As such, for me, ""The Gentlemen"" earns an underwhelming 4+/10 rating.","Stylish and Gritty, But Marred by Excessive Violence and Mocking Tone"
wheatley-20230,1,29 April 2024,"This series inhabits a moral vacuum in which entertainment is the only watchword. And there is entertainment. Unlikeable, but interesting, characters duck and dive in a criminal underworld plot, that offers some suspense and gives us a hero to root for, as the Duke strives to drag his family away from these nasty shenanigans.Then, in the final episode the Duke decides to forget all his objections and become a drug lord. That change killed the only reason I had stuck with this sorry series, hoping to see the Duke triumph against the odds. Instead I watched him commit murder without a qualm. Is this how low we are prepared to stoop in order to be entertained?",Absolutely loathed it
braidlord,1,9 May 2024,"8 episodes is far too long. I couldn't wait to finish it. Bored all the way through it.First episode starts with cheesy unoriginal characters taken from Guy Ritchie's various films (which I love) but they just do not work on this series.So many horrible characters continue to come into each episode with over the top script and trying to be witty.....Coke dealing gangsters from Liverpool who just so happens to be a reverend, a weed empire owned by a London gangsta who is in a luxury jail getting served by a Michelin star chef whilst his daughter manages the business... whilst she continues to mention her love for her brother despite him being a completely pointless character who rarely speaks in the whole series.A Serial killing female who deals with luxurious stolen cars with links to South American gangs, Vinny Jones playing a gardener who just so happens in own 20 guns of various sizes but actually wasn't needed in any part of the story due to the back and forth twists that basically ended up being pointlessMost scenes end up being too long to keep you interested and by the end of each mini story line, you kind of lose interest in any sub plot that is worth mentioning.Some great actors in the series but overall, an absolute waste of my time watching it.Couldn't wait for it to end.Guy R needs to stick to films with his fast paced, hard hitting director skills.This series kind of reminds me of all his films out together. Unfortunately, it's not always the best bits.Guy R has even used the camera angles and action shots - remember Golden Brown playing in the background in Snatch where we first see the power of Mickey's punch knocking out Gorgeous George - the camera spins looking down but it just doesn't work in The Gentleman when the shot has been used again.",Couldn't wait to get to the end - awful
jangomango-62344,1,31 March 2024,"The whole series is shockingly bad with no actual interesting content. It follows the same boring cliches as all his other shows and it seems Guy richie is only interested in trying to make a series as ""cool"" and ""edgy"" as possible, with chicken suits, rich characters committing crimes, nazi radicalists, chinese executioners, green lamborghinis, missing fingers, overused swearing, christian psychos, etc.seems like guy richie is just attempting to copy everything he's done before with minimal changes. He uses scouse gangsters instead of cockney gangsters ( snatch) and uses boxing gyms repeatedly to tie in these gangsters to be amazing fighters. It's all so linear, boring and plain.",Disappointing
cdb-22,3,20 March 2024,"I wasn't really looking forward to watching this , just the mere presences of the con man Vinny Jones , dreadful footballer and even worse actor was enough to make me realise that this was not going to be a quality show but I didn't expect it to be quite as bad as it clearly isI couldn't work out what it is supposed to be , is it meant to be a serious drama or a comedy ? Well whatever it is it fails miserably in my view.The script is trite , the characters contrived and unconvincing and the acting embarrasing
.This is really typical British drivel , with regional stereotyping all over it and no redeeming features , I gave it 20 minutes before I turned off and that was really too long , don't waste any time on this.",Tripe
au561,4,3 May 2024,"I have slogged through the first five episodes and I'm throwing in the towel. Th series began with a somewhat interesting premise, but quickly ran off the rails into just another creative cul-de-sac. Most of the characters are too stupid for words, and couldn't find a lit candle in a dark room. Everyone of the cast is trying to be so wry that they have forgotten how to be clever. This scenario needs a directorial hand that knows how to get dash and panache out of the actors with out letting them chew the scenery. This needed the same touch as the first of the Kingsmen films. That sure directing style is completely missing. I will say adieu. Too ritchie for me.","Far-fetched, near-fetched, and too fetched."
kh-17438,3,6 May 2024,"It was touch and go for the viewer, and I was completely engrossed in the plot. The responsible brother was busy saving the day for his sibling who was in very mortal danger with very bad
criminals, and responsible brother willingly intertwined his existence with what will surely prove to be ruthless criminals operating a grow operation. For now they're pot farmers hiding in plain sight in his great English house.But alas, the irresponsible brother is off to gamble and throw away the money his brother put everything on the line for, and the mannerisms of the irresponsible brother were way over the top, and there, the show lost me. The irresponsible brother seemed to be over acting and I never finished the episode.",Lacking Credulity
scfitandfabulous,4,7 May 2024,"I know, let's make a film and try and squeeze every genre of gangster we can into it! I get writers and directors have their style but Ritchie's movies are literally the same film with different actors. It's like Richie's the rich kid who wants to be like the gangsters, but he's a privileged gangster who looks up to them with starry eyes.This show is so generic, really boring and really not funny. The only thing I'm enjoying is Vinnie Jones.There's no way I'll waste another hour watching another episode of this rubbish! Also.... Why is it always a Liverpudlian or cockney gangster!? I want a Welsh gangster for a change!",What is Ritchie's obsession?
